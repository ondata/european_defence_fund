The differentiating factor of HYBRID is to offer all these features in an easy to use, compact package.

First, partners will define the system's overall architecture and derive the specifications of all sub-assemblies, subsystems, and components. Then, partners will implement Vertical Take-off and Landing capability, ruggedize the airframe, design high-end ruggedized electronics and object recognition features. In the end, the integration will be carried out to conduct a test campaign in real conditions with representative end-users.

missions, but rather must be utilized in multiple, simultaneous operations and be able to classify different entities like multiple UAVs,
RAM (Rockets, Artillery, Mortar), missiles, aircraft, helicopters. The introduction of Multi-missions- Radars (MMRs) was indeed a game
changer. Advances on many fronts have collectively brought about increasing levels of miniaturisation and integration in antenna
architecture and beamforming. Due to continuous increased in functionality, available space in fighter planes and helicopters
becomes less and less, the need for even smaller antenna (RF front end (RFFE)) becomes more and more a necessity and there is a
continuous need for drastic SWaP improvements. POWERPACK proposes to develop disruptive technologies for RF MEMS for high

missions, but rather must be utilized in multiple, simultaneous operations and be able to classify different entities like multiple UAVs,
RAM (Rockets, Artillery, Mortar), missiles, aircraft, helicopters. The introduction of Multi-missions- Radars (MMRs) was indeed a game
changer. Advances on many fronts have collectively brought about increasing levels of miniaturisation and integration in antenna
architecture and beamforming. Due to continuous increased in functionality, available space in fighter planes and helicopters
becomes less and less, the need for even smaller antenna (RF front end (RFFE)) becomes more and more a necessity and there is a
continuous need for drastic SWaP improvements. POWERPACK proposes to develop disruptive technologies for RF MEMS for high
frequency and high-power operation / RF NEMS and their monolithic integration with standard technology GaN LNA and RF MEMS /

Therefore, there is a growing demand to deal with RFI in a efficient and affordable way, both for civil and military use- and here is where RFSHIELD is positioned.
The main objective of RFSHIELD project is to increase the availability and performance of COMSATCOM/MILSATCOM services for military users by developing a European-made solution to protect the SatCom services from intentional and non-intentional interferences. It is the first European solution, that aims to do it in a waveform agnostic way while it is interoperable with the network equipment.
We are tackling two scenarios, CASE 1 and CASE 2, where the RFSHIELD solution is used either on-ground or space segments:
-CASE 1: On the ground platform, RFSHIELD addresses wideband communication scenarios: the solution will detect and remove the interference on ground infrastructure (on-camp remote terminals and hub side) in military X, Ku, and Ka bands. The interferers are both external (jamming, radar or other terrestrial sources), or from the own defense unit (own ECM, ECCM systems)
-CASE 2: On the space segment, RFSHIELD aims to protect a satellite payload working on UHF frequency with narrowband signals, mainly used for critical communications and positioning service.

The multidisciplinary and highly specialised Consortium will present the results of EU-GUARDIAN, which will facilitate the tedious task of analysing large amounts of data; will improve cyber operational capability; drive a reduction in costs; and above all, they will contribute to EU cyber defence posture and to the laying of the foundations for prompting the EU autonomy in development and capacitation of AI-based resources.""",44175699,file.txt,"Artificial Intelligence,Automatization,Cyber Defence,Decision Support Systems,Risk Management",SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD,44181033101103044,101103044,EDF-2021-CYBER-R-CDAI-2,10,0,13454545,"999959130,952774935,968727943,985086411,958304323,999754363,998627417,999987745,999844282,899914203",2022-12-01T00:00:00.000+0100,44181033,44173368,text/plain,2021 - 2027,EU-GUARDIAN,European Defence Fund (EDF),2024-12-26T18:00:15.414+0100,"INDRA SISTEMAS SA,AIRBUS CYBERSECURITY SAS,BALTIJOS PAZANGIU TECHNOLOGIJU INSTITUTAS,WISER TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS EOOD,INSTITUT PO OTBRANA,CYBERNETICA AS,LEONARDO - SOCIETA PER  AZIONI,UNIVERSITA DEGLI STUDI DI ROMA LA SAPIENZA,UNIVERSIDAD DE MURCIA,INDRA FACTORIA TECNOLOGICA SL","20000883,20000890,20000944,20000841,20000841,20000880,20000922,20000922,20000883,20000883",100,https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/44181033/101103044/EDF,https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/44181033/101103044/EDF,13454545,2022-12-09T00:00:00.000+0100,2024-12-26T18:00:15.399+0100,European Defence Fund (EDF),45297762,"ES30,FR10,LT01,BG34,BG41,EE00,ITI4,ITI4,ES62,ES30",European Defence Fund (EDF),EDF,2024-10-24T13:28:56.897+0200

SHOLFEA includes studies, design, prototyping and testing, addressing the following main ideas:

-	Family conception: Innovative concept of shoulder launched weapons integrating inter-connectable aiming systems and ammunition with different effective ranges, calibers and effects, conceived as a single ‘family’ to cover the operational needs of several European Users. 
-	Modular design will be used for all elements. Particularly the Firing Control Units (FCU) and aiming systems developed within SHOLFEA will have a modular design that could be adapted to the necessities of the customer, allowing easy upgradation and several configurations compatible with different ammunition types.

-	Integration on training means: Particularly with in-door simulators, allowing the users to be efficiently trained with all possible FCU + ammunition combinations of the weapon system family. 
-	Integration on Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs): SHOLFEA will assess the requirements and features for the integration of Shoulder Launched Weapon Systems in mini-class UGVs, so that the dismounted soldier will be able to decide whether to operate the Weapon System from the shoulder or remotely (human-in-the-loop) from the UGV, increasing the operational range of engagement.

Techniques for incident management, detection and response based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) are particularly promising in this respect; sophisticated attacks call for detection and response in an automated fashion requiring defence tools that can learn and adapt to changes in the cyber environment – in other words, tools using AI. This is where the project AInception comes into play. 
AInception will develop novel AI-based tools and techniques for detection and response: from detecting adversarial behaviour from logs and network traffic; to understanding, contextualizing and explaining the detected threat; to generating risk and impact aware response action; all the way to automating the execution and evaluation of the response action on the underlying infrastructure. AI will play a central role for all these steps in the AInception tool pipeline. These tools will be combined into a proof-of-concept end to-end detection and response prototype, evaluated in operational scenarios with end users. Selected tools coming out of the project will be integrated in the cyber defence platform developed by the PANDORA project, as well as existing commercial products and services of the partners.

The project will prototype, test, and demonstrate the operational capabilities of 5G integrated in selected defence platforms and systems. 5G COMPAD has the potential to disrupt the defence communication standards used today, enabling enhanced operational capabilities of the armed forces on the strategic, operational and tactical levels, for peacetime activities in homeland, overseas deployments as well as operations in hostile environments. Project outcome will strengthen the European industry, contribute towards strategic autonomy, and secure supply of key technology from trusted vendors within Europe.""",44175699,file.txt,5G,SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD,44181033101103519,101103519,EDF-2021-C4ISR-D-COMS-2,24,0,36934211.47,"999959615,999910921,999966696,999647372,999971934,998627417,888763083,889655677,996235688,907711936,999910630,910945140,999789574,906133746,999584128,895106689,953622230,952011157,996375562,895532034,897241465,890652158,995925967,950760051",2022-12-01T00:00:00.000+0100,44181033,45095537,text/plain,2021 - 2027,5G COMPAD,European Defence Fund (EDF),2025-02-07T05:05:02.210+0100,"SAAB AKTIEBOLAG,ERICSSON AB,RHEINMETALL ELECTRONICS GMBH,BITTIUM WIRELESS OY,THALES SIX GTS FRANCE SAS,LEONARDO - SOCIETA PER  AZIONI,INSTER TECNOLOGIA Y COMUNICACIONESSA,EIGHT BELLS HELLAS I.K.E.,INTRACOM DEFENSE AE,CAFA TECH OU,TELENOR ASA,SINTEF AS,FORSVARETS FORSKNINGINSTITUTT,LATVIJAS MOBILAIS TELEFONS SIA,AIT AUSTRIAN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY GMBH,SYNKZONE AB,BHE BONN HUNGARY ELEKTRONIKAI KORLATOLT FELELOSSEGU TARSASAG,APR TECHNOLOGIES AB,NOKIA SOLUTIONS AND NETWORKS KFT,ERICSSON FRANCE,BITTIUM SAFEMOVE OY,THALES DIS FRANCE SAS,THALES ITALIA SPA,NOKIA NETWORKS FRANCE","20001001,20001001,20000873,20000885,20000890,20000922,20000883,20000902,20000902,20000880,20000974,20000974,20000974,20000946,20000832,20001001,20000913,20001001,20000913,20000890,20000885,20000890,20000922,20000890",72.77,https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/44181033/101103519/EDF,https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/44181033/101103519/EDF,26876918.68,2022-12-16T00:00:00.000+0100,2025-02-07T05:05:02.192+0100,European Defence Fund (EDF),45297744,"SE12,SE11,DE50,FI1D,FR10,ITI4,ES30,EL64,EL64,EE00,NO08,NO06,NO08,LV00,AT13,SE11,HU11,SE12,HU11,FR10,FI1B,FR10,ITI1,FR10",European Defence Fund (EDF),EDF,2024-10-29T01:25:46.460+0100

After a state-of-the-art of surveillance technologies, the definition of the user, mission and technical requirements, the finalisation of common specifications, the project will Design, Prototype, and Test the following systems:

- Ground and Space-based systems to detect illegitimate activities such as jamming and spoofing in GNSS frequency bands and geolocate sources of malicious activities.
- An information-management subsystem (IMS) that establishes and updates the situational awareness picture collecting data coming from the different systems through a common interface. A GUI dedicated to operational centres will be developed to be used by the Member States for data exploitation and interaction with the IMS.
- 5 PRS mobile receivers consisting of dismounted, handheld, wearable or miniaturized receivers, embedding advanced anti-jamming and anti-spoofing technologies will be developed for dedicated military applications and to contribute to the overall NAVWAR capability.

After a state-of-the-art of surveillance technologies, the definition of the user, mission and technical requirements, the finalisation of common specifications, the project will Design, Prototype, and Test the following systems:

- Ground and Space-based systems to detect illegitimate activities such as jamming and spoofing in GNSS frequency bands and geolocate sources of malicious activities.
- An information-management subsystem (IMS) that establishes and updates the situational awareness picture collecting data coming from the different systems through a common interface. A GUI dedicated to operational centres will be developed to be used by the Member States for data exploitation and interaction with the IMS.
- 5 PRS mobile receivers consisting of dismounted, handheld, wearable or miniaturized receivers, embedding advanced anti-jamming and anti-spoofing technologies will be developed for dedicated military applications and to contribute to the overall NAVWAR capability.

process capacity and IMINT analysts.
IntSen2 aims at researching a disruptive change, using Artificial Intelligence to develop a concept of application for an IMINT service,
from a reactive service design to a proactive service design. And it does so by basing the research and proposed solutions exclusively
on European assets in order to support EU operational autonomy. This proposal, therefore, will design a system to fully automatize
the IMINT workflow, consisting of: i) Automatic Acquisition, ii) Automatic Pre-processing; iii) (Key Challenge) Automatic Extraction, iv)

Two technologies using Artificial Intelligence lie at the core of the solution that IntSen2 proposes:
- Super-resolution: Improving the resolution of imagery by a factor of 4 allows imagery from Sentinel satellites to provide
value in security scenarios.
- Automatic Extraction: Applying AI based extraction techniques to super-resolved Sentinel imagery can unlock the use of all
operational potential of Sentinel for security scenarios.

-	on systems : EU-wide consensus on Modular Open System Architecture, compatibility to EU Systems of Systems, as well as systems specifications
-	on structure : addressing the whole Life-Cycle, we will investigate modular structure concepts, use of new manufacturing techniques, multi-functional structural elements, and advanced maintenance concepts
-	power architecture and power plant : working on the right power architectures for new platforms, as well as defining pan-EU positions on zero-emission / carbon-neutral technologies , and defining likely needs for next generation rotorcraft engines.

Space-based Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems have become more and more performant and versatile. They are providing an ever-increasing number of services to support strategic, tactical and operational activities in security and defence. Technological developments have continuously improved performances but also lowered the costs of high-resolution systems. Over the past years, they have also made it possible to develop space solutions that answer military needs for shorter revisit periods (increased persistency), shorter end-to-end delays (system latency), new applications (e.g. night vision) or support to tactical operations.
Recent events have confirmed the important contribution of Space ISR to military operations as well as how critical reactivity and timely availability of data are. Keeping pace with the latest evolutions in Space ISR is essential for European security.
Today, several European countries operate Space ISR systems, either as national assets or under specific transnational cooperation agreements. These systems use a wide variety of traditional spaceborne sensors (optical, radar, SIGINT) and have provided European defence with an extensive experience on the use of Space ISR. Many European countries, which do not have direct access to a Space ISR system, receive space imagery through transnational cooperation.
Because the existing systems are operated independently, their revisit, persistency, reactivity and data diversity added value are limited to what each of them can offer on its own. Similarly, support at tactical level is only possible with nationally operated assets because current transnational data sharing time response is not compatible with tactical support.
The current organisation of multiple independent systems limits the capability to answer emerging needs on new applications, improved revisit, decreased latency or persistency at an affordable cost.
The Space Based Persistent ISR for Defence and Europe Reinforcement (SPIDER) project’s ambition is to provide European countries with Space ISR capabilities that are capable to answer to these new military needs in a cost-effective way.

This SPIDER proposal is a feasibility study about multi-mission affordable satellites constellations dedicated to space-based ISR for European defence. With the aim of providing:
- High reactivity, including autonomous re-tasking
- Short revisit periods
- Short end to end system latency
- Compatibility with existing national systems
- Compatibility with other European ISR initiative (e.g. CoHGI or AI for defence)

The main components of the system studied are:
1/ New self-standing small satellites constellations, able to cover a wide variety of mission: video, optical night vision, SAR, SIGINT, EM spectrum monitoring, Hyperspectral. The project considers various technological and operational options in order to achieve the system objectives, such as: non-heliosynchronous orbits, inter-satellite links, advanced on-board processing, improved data downlink capabilities… Cost efficiency will be major driver during design trade-offs.
2/ A User Service Centre, called Federation Layer, which provides end-users access to the satellites constellations from a single interface. It can also give access to other existing space systems that offer shared services. This centre supports various forms of transnational cooperation and automatically handles the sharing rules defined by each partner.

Activities will be guided by inputs from the Member States Ministries of Defence. They will set the operational requirements and use-cases, which will drive the design and Concept of Operations. The project will include:
- The preliminary design of the system, including preliminary performances analyses.
- A study of how several new technologies can contribute to better or new capabilities in space and ground systems. This will include risk reduction simulations or demonstrations.

- Improving lead-free piezoelectric materials manufacturing processes: increase the manufacturing readiness level of the most mature lead-free piezoelectric materials and bring out one or more European industrial supplier of lead-free piezoelectric materials for sonar transducers. 
- PZT substitution in sonar transducers: increase the technology maturity of lead-free piezoelectric materials for PZT substitution in sonar applications and assess these new materials for sonar applications on representative test transducers under operational constraints.

The best solution to this challenge appears to be to unite the forces of European partners and to translate this union into a common European federated framework for cyber physical testing with a common architecture and shared tool set.

This strategy includes a common way of orchestrating tests from different European cyber range environments, each specialized on certain types of cyber-attacks on specific systems, products or components. The availability of common services and access to an almost unlimited number of scenarios, enables partners to establish new test sites tailored to their expertise. 

The federation of these capabilities across Europe will ensure an improved and coordinated cyber security focus, enhance the performance and productivity, and reduce risk and cost compared to stand alone Cyber range environments. More so, the common environment will stimulate to collaboration in new dimensions absolutely indispensable to counter future cyber threats.

The concept of AIDEDeX relies on the strong foundations of the on-going project AIDED (https://aided-padr.eu/) in which the consortium is carrying out the technology development, offering a solid base for an highly reliable platform in AIDEDeX. The main focus is on the automated detection of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) using Artificial Intelligence techniques on data collected from a large suite of sensors such as Electro-Magnetic Inference (EMI), Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR), X-Ray Backscatter Imaging (XRB), Raman Spectrometer, Infrared Cameras, Multispectral Cameras and Chemical. This set of sensors, or a combination of them, allows to determine the position and type of the IED and landmines with a maximum accuracy while minimising every risk. 

A fleet of mixed Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV) and Aerial (UAV) will be able to operate in different challenges and scenarios, from open space fields to more risky closed environments and urban scenarios, of increasing interest for security in cities. The system will be able to plan the mission in complete autonomy, receiving just the perimeter of the area to explore. One of the UGV will also be equipped with a robotic arm for manipulation of the IED with different manipulation systems, such as pliers with force feedback to carefully grab the object, scissors to cut wires and air-compressed gun to clean eventual dust or cover on the ordnance. The core idea of this approach is to provide a fully autonomous intelligent system, with capabilities of merging and analysing data from heterogeneous sensors and decisional autonomy to operate on the environment, with performances that overcome the more consolidated approach of human operator and teleoperated robot. It would allow to overcome classical issues as environments with telecommunication denial and intrinsic difficulties in operating several robots of different dimensions and with different locomotion systems, while increasing at the same time the capacity of the operator to control the system, using hybrid interfaces between teleoperation and semi-autonomous algorithms. 

The innovations resulting from the project include a complete, reliable robotics solution (mission planning, deploying, monitoring) compatible with a large range of applications.

For the emergency management and military operational capabilities of EU nations, the complete real-time awareness of the scenario is crucial to increase mission effectiveness and enable risk mitigation actions. In this context, unmanned platforms can be the best option thanks to the absence of a pilot that makes them “expendables” in harsh environments (i.e., nuclear plant disaster, large fire events) or war scenarios.
The intrinsic limitations of convenient small and cheap solutions, like the reduced autonomy and the poor capability in terms of data transmission and computational power can drastically reduce the attractiveness for missions requiring the ground stations being very far from the target location (i.e., nuclear plant disaster or heavy combat scenarios). These weaknesses can be overcome by implementing a sort of “unmanned flying bridge” able to operate as a communication bridge between the small drones flying over the target and the ground station, carrying and releasing the swarm of drones in a location close to the target to maximize the efficiency of the mission by exploiting the whole mini-drones’ autonomy, coordinating the swarm in an automatic or semi-automatic way.
The goal of the EAGLES project is to fill the current design and technological gaps, by performing studies and conceptual design activities on the “flying bridge“ and by studying technologies that will facilitate the development of a System of Systems, nowadays not present on the market, that will give EU defence actors the capability of collecting data and gain information for prompt and effective decision making at low costs and reduced risk.

These weaknesses can be overcome by implementing a sort of “unmanned flying bridge” able to operate as a communication bridge between the small drones flying over the target and the ground station, carrying and releasing the swarm of drones in a location close to the target to maximize the efficiency of the mission by exploiting the whole mini-drones’ autonomy, coordinating the swarm in an automatic or semi-automatic way.
The goal of the EAGLES project is to fill the current design and technological gaps, by performing studies and conceptual design activities on the “flying bridge“ and by studying technologies that will facilitate the development of a System of Systems, nowadays not present on the market, that will give EU defence actors the capability of collecting data and gain information for prompt and effective decision making at low costs and reduced risk.
More in details, EAGLES will focus on the development of communication technologies for both hardware and software, artificial intelligence techniques to manage the mini-drone swarm and to process data acquired by mission sensors, and autonomous flight techniques to assure the drop and rendezvous of mini-drones.""",45095551,file.txt,"UAV,coordinated mini-drone swarms,UAV mothership,encrypted long-distance communication,surveillance,secure retreat,site securing",SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD,44181033101121404,101121404,EDF-2022-LS-RA-SMERO-NT,6,0,3791471.79,"991776016,999789768,930253669,884590822,999691313,937531385",2023-12-01T00:00:00.000+0100,44181033,45095543,text/plain,2021 - 2027,EAGLES,European Defence Fund (EDF),2024-12-27T01:54:43.858+0100,"IBK-INNOVATION GMBH & CO.

The future combination of electromagnetic artillery guns with adapted hypersonic projectiles will integrate advanced concepts, promising technologies and innovations to benefit operational effectiveness. Such a system is expected to improve the effectiveness and protection of future European land and naval systems and critical assets. 
The project aims to maturate Electromagnetic Gun (EMG) critical components, notably the pulsed-power supply, the ElectroMagnetic RailGun and the hypervelocity projectile. THEMA will offer a hypersonic interceptor with enhanced precision and lethality to defeat the main challenging threats, and without propellant material significantly increasing the survivability of such system to enemy fires. It is a significantly differentiating and innovative approach bringing strong advantages over existing solutions. In addition, EMG will complement other defensive means (missiles, cannons) and could be adapted to various platforms: first to big ships and permanent land systems for air defence, but also later with further technological development to smaller assets (like small ships), and for long-range precision strike.
The project involves 18 entities established in 9 Member States, including 6 large enterprises, 6 SMEs, 5 non-profit research entities and 1 MidCap. It federates a cross-border eco-system based on excellence, involving system integrators, turret manufacturers and ammunition specialists, high-skilled SMEs, research and military institutes.

Recently, there is a growing interest in developing Hybrid Autonomous Unmanned Vehicles (HAUVs) that are capable of air-water trans-media continuous and uninterrupted motion and performance.

The main idea of PASITHEA project is to develop a new design combining the well-known UAV’s and UUV’s technologies into a multi-technology Hybrid Unmanned Vehicle, which can fly, hover in the air and sail, hover under the water, whilst having the ability to repeat air/water trans-media transitions.

The HAUV will be able to be launched and recovered from platforms/units operated and controlled by land, sea (surface/underwater) and air. The project includes the design of a high-level control, command, communication, and intelligence (C3I) system. The carrier vessel/unit can also be embedded with point-to-multipoint networking through the HAUV, meaning that after it releases the HAUV, the system can communicate and relay data with friendly forces operating nearby.

The drone will be designed to return to the operator or to an indicated/preset position either manually, autonomously or combined using an advanced mission planning subsystem. The fact that it is released from underwater means it could will not necessarily be expendable, but recoverable from the underwater mother carrier.

The idea of the projected was based on the fact that recent naval operations in various areas were carried out successfully in a joint environment in which much useful information was generated by unmanned aerial and underwater vehicles. Through these experiences, operators have gained insight into the nature of more complex threats and how they are dealt with to assure successful and effective military operations. Furthermore, vital coast-line infrastructures, as well as inland infrastructures must be defended against threats—some “asymmetric” and some sophisticated—which can be either marine or aerial in nature. These threats are often characterized by their mobility and may be attempted over extended periods of time. Thus, surveillance must take place over wide areas and operate over long time periods, which can have increased risks and wearing/fatigue for the personnel involved. The possible costs and risks involved make strong arguments for the expanded use of unmanned vehicles in modern operations.

Attracted by the prospect of lower unit cost and risk of unmanned vehicles compared to manned vehicles, all the Services have been actively using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs), unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), and unmanned undersea vehicles (UUVs). Based on the operational results, it has become widely suggested that unmanned vehicle systems can be assigned for many operational tasks. Since the operational capability and military worth of unmanned vehicles has been demonstrated in recent military operations, it is essential to exploit and develop on existing capabilities. It is deemed important to develop critical autonomous vehicle-related technologies that are considered essential to the accomplishment of future multidiscipline naval missions.

The concept of the PASITHEA application and the derived relevant technologies have not been combinedly applied in the European defence sector previously. The PASITHEA concept has the potential not only to significantly alter the way that defence forces operate, but to potentially be applied in other domains as well.

The project aims to provide the operators with a strategic advantage, enhancing military multidiscipline operations. In this respect, different application scenarios / concepts can be envisaged.
However, technical challenges where research is needed to develop the envisaged system must be faced.

The project’s scope is to:

•	Introduce a new combined technology to enhance military multidiscipline operations capable for utilization from all scale of a force formation (from task unit to task force)
•	Optimize decisio

The goal of LATACC is to develop a solution that enhances, optimizes, automates and accelerates the tactical command and combat capacities for operational superiority in this context. LATACC will improve coalitions collaborative capabilities from Brigade command post down to combat vehicles, dismounted soldier and unmanned assets.
LATACC adapts and enhances legacy systems, develops new technologies and integrates them into a common European framework based on an open middleware architecture. LATACC interfaces with national legacy Vetronics, as well as Battle Management Systems, other domains (air, space, cyber) and civilian systems based on an standardized approach (such as FMN or NGVA). Artificial Intelligence, Mission Optimization and Collaboration services are at the core of LATACC.
The project activities, over a period of 3 years, consist of (i) studies to analyse European User requirements and common operational scenarios, existing standards and key enabling technologies and define an open architecture and its key components: core and COI services, integration of multiple legacies and emerging assets; (ii) design of the solution’s key components and (iii) prototyping and demoing in interconnected industrial labs as well as a in real-world to validate the operational benefits.
LATACC involves 32 participants and 2 subcontractors from 13 countries combining large defence companies supplying land tactical combat legacy systems, SMEs, midcaps and research institutes. In addition to operational, technical and industrial benefits, LATACC stimulates cross border cooperation, drive innovation, increase the competitiveness of the European Defence industry and reinforce European sovereignty.

However, the specificities of these products do not allow a straightforward use of civilian electronics. Therefore, mastering advanced packaging technologies and architectures is key to produce world-class defence products. 
EPICURE aims at giving Europe the means to master its future in advanced packaging. EPICURE will generate and integrate knowledge in advanced packaging technologies and architectures, perform the related studies and designs and prepare the supply chains to offer integration solution compatible with severe defence constraints and low volume production.
New trends in integration beyond Moore law are based on Heterogeneous Integration. EDA and DG studies have confirmed the need to develop advanced packaging technologies and shared Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test services (OSAT) in Europe, as the most advanced technologies are located in Far East or in US and are not accessible or under usage restriction. 
The project will analyze use cases requirements and constraints, and combine these towards modular architectures based on future chiplets. Elementary technological bricks such as advanced substrate down to 15µm L/S, wafer level packaging, Die to Die interconnect IP will be developed to build a “packaging toolbox”. Design engineering concerns will be addressed to identify the design flow, the design and assembly rules to build a “Physical Design Kit”. Five technology demonstrators will be designed, manufactured and tested to prequalify the toolbox. 
The aim is to develop in Europe OSAT and technology providers in the field of advanced packaging serving defence needs. These ambitious goals are achievable because the partners will bring advanced technologies i.e. advanced wafer level packaging from IZM, die-to-die interconnect from Extoll, new interposer for RF from UMS, heterogeneous integration packaging and test from Synergie CAD.

With a large European footprint (14 European nations represented in the team), the SESIOP project  aims to increase interoperability of military Air C2 systems against SES rules thanks to the definition of an architectural solution which will ensure that data exchange between civil-military and military-military control centres uses the latest technologies developed, in particular the achievements reached in the SESAR framework (e.g. SWIM technologies, Trajectory Based Operations etc.) ensuring a seamless evolution towards efficient, secured and safe operations, in planning, tasking and execution phases. The SESIOP project will include a deep analysis of the current “as is” situation in terms of interaction between European Air C2 and ATC centres, and of the operational needs.

With a large European footprint (14 European nations represented in the team), the SESIOP project  aims to increase interoperability of military Air C2 systems against SES rules thanks to the definition of an architectural solution which will ensure that data exchange between civil-military and military-military control centres uses the latest technologies developed, in particular the achievements reached in the SESAR framework (e.g. SWIM technologies, Trajectory Based Operations etc.) ensuring a seamless evolution towards efficient, secured and safe operations, in planning, tasking and execution phases. The SESIOP project will include a deep analysis of the current “as is” situation in terms of interaction between European Air C2 and ATC centres, and of the operational needs.

ODIN’S EYE II will mainly focus on the following targets:
•	A SBMEW Architecture and CONOPS maturation, aiming to elaborate and consolidate SBMEW architecture and its pillars for joint missions;
•	The development of an End-to-End SBMEW simulator;
•	Breadboards and technology de-risking activities, aimed to increase the maturity of key components, whose development may represent a critical path on the development plans.
The project, coordinated by OHB System in Germany, is built on the successful consortium (34 partners from 12 Member States) currently in place for the EDIDP 2020 ODIN’S EYE feasibility study. The consortium underpinning this follow-on project (comprised of 43 partners from 14 Member States and 7 subcontractors) will continue to support a balanced geographical (as well as geopolitical) distribution of partners across European Member States and associated countries.
The project is committed to leverage and consolidate collaborative efforts by Member States by developing a common Space-Based Missile Early Warning capability to respond. The system will also serve as the Early Warning pillar of the PESCO TWISTER project.

The proposed project, starting from the results of the CARMENTA Phase 1 project, will proceed with the Subsystems Detailed Design categorized in three classes: High Development Item (HDI) with major technological improvements, Low Development Item (LDI) with minor technological improvements and Non-Development Item (NDI) limited to implementation of features to make them compatible with Carmenta ecosystem.

The innovative technological improvements will be verified, at subsystems and system level, by means of a Demonstrators that will be tested in a laboratory environment with an appropriate set of stimuli and monitoring. After that in order to step up to TRL 7 the design will be updated as necessary and a Prototype, for all or part of the subsystems will be realized, integrated and installed in an existing rotary wing aircraft made available by the Italian Air Force, and a Fight Test campaign will be carried. In addition, a digital model of each subsystem will be designed and developed, to be integrated in a simulation engine of overall system to support analysis and for evaluation of its behaviour when operate in different scenarios and in different configurations.

The DAA system observes the environment surrounding the Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA), detects traffic, assesses the risk of collision, informs and provides suggestions to the Remote Pilot (RP) to remain well clear and, when appropriate generates a new flight path to avoid collision. This way, DAA enables the RPA, or Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), to operate along with other manned and unmanned aircraft, allowing a much more flexible use of RPAS/UAS than today, in order to train for, and conduct, security and defence missions in peacetime, crisis and conflict.
The European Detect and Avoid System - Part 2 project (herein abbreviated “EUDAAS2”) will complete the development of the DAA system for RPAS, designed and validated in the EDIDP 2019 Part 1 (herein abbreviated “EUDAAS1”), delivering (via EUROCAE) a full suite of required DAA standard updates supporting the provision of the ETSO baseline (by EASA), for the future system certification and product industrialization phase. 
The project’s Mission, as defined by the EDF-2023-DA-C4ISR-DAA topic scope, is to provide a fully standardised, qualified and certifiable DAA solution for UAS. The DAA solution should aim at fully integrating RPAS in the general airspace (A-G classes) without any limitations regarding operation in the airspace including in TMA.
The EUDAAS project runs over 4 years and is executed by a core the team maintained from EUDAAS1, supported by 5 contributing Member States and additional 6 nations cross-border partners.

BODYGUARD will be able to classify the types of manoeuvres being made from far distance thus rising an alarm early. In close proximity, it can detect weak-points of the threat satellite and counteract with a robot or laser. Detection is accomplished using AI onboard processing from multiple sensor inputs, including highly sensitive optical greyscale and IR cameras with various FOVs, laser ranging and LiDAR systems. Self-protection actions are based on high-intensity laser beam, microwave and high-voltage applications as well as a micro-robot that rendezvous to a weak spot of the threat satellite to disable it. 

The EDF-2023-RA-SPACE-PSA grant allows to perform knowledge generation, studies and design activities.

The project will prepare a roadmap to develop this future ammunition family with longer range and higher accuracy within the timeframe 2030, offering an artillery projectile able to cover 60km at least, offering a 10m class CEP and a rocket able to cover 150 km range minimum and with a 10m class CEP. For this purpose, FIRES 2 will use FIRES’ output to save time on the research phase, push forward feasibility studies and perform a comprehensive design of the most innovative concepts for the following subsystems: propulsion, seeker, airframe, GNC, communications command and control, payload, computer vision, computational unit and power supply.

The scope of the project will include the design, implementation and validation of a deployable portable infrastructure (military vehicle), and a fixed platform that will collect the information and train the system.""""""",45095551,file.txt,"Satellite Communication,SatCom,Interference,SIGINT, Jamming,Space Awareness,Counter Communication System",SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD,44181033101168148,101168148,EDF-2023-LS-DA-SME-NT,5,0,5882691.45,"997636853,888336380,894250082,916943523,935534931",2024-12-01T00:00:00.000+0100,44181033,45095543,text/plain,2021 - 2027,SDAM4PRD,European Defence Fund (EDF),2025-02-17T14:05:46.453+0100,"INTEGRASYS SA,""AICOX SOLUCIONES, SA"",ECLIPTIC DEFENCE AND SPACE LTD,EXUS SOFTWARE MONOPROSOPI ETAIRIA PERIORISMENIS EVTHINIS,SENTECH SRL","20000883,20000883,20000871,20000902,20000922",,https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/44181033/101168148/EDF,https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/44181033/101168148/EDF,5882691.45,2024-11-20T00:00:00.000+0100,2025-02-17T14:05:46.443+0100,European Defence Fund (EDF),46029443,"ES30,ES30,CY00,EL30,ITI4",European Defence Fund (EDF),EDF,2025-02-17T14:05:46.453+0100

EMISSARY’s value proposition focuses on four interconnected beacons: sovereignty in detection, tracking, and characterization of space objects; shared European recognized space picture to sMS based on enhanced SSA data; integration into the international landscape; and establishing a robust European data security policy. It emphasizes the development of a network of advanced sensors and a military SSA Command and Control (C2) software to process and circulate data, ensuring national and European sovereignty while fostering EDTIB collaboration.

The project involves government agencies, industries, SME and midcaps, scientific communities and RTOs, and integrating international initiatives and innovative technologies. It encompasses 51 partners from 13 Member States, 12 of which has signed the Letter of Intent, ensuring continuity and expansion of expertise from previous projects like INTEGRAL and SAURON. EMISSARY aims to achieve a prototyping, demonstration and qualification stage for a large set of the technologies developed, reflecting a commitment to advancing European military SSA capabilities, ensuring security and sustainability in space, and enhancing Europe's strategic autonomy and international competitiveness in the space domain.
