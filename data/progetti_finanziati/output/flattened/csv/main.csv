• Research on innovative and low-cost CB monitoring technologies installed on UAV and UGV systems (building inter alia on the H2020 projects ROCSAFE and 5G!Drones, and focusing on miniaturization of previously deployed technological solutions);
• Research on innovative sampling technologies based primarily on the concept of “smart swabs”, enabling fast and non-destructive in situ analysis of a sample that can later be analyzed a second time in the lab by standard forensic;
• Nearly real-time 3D mapping and processing of areas affected by CBRN contamination (indoor and outdoor), with a high-degree of autonomy.
• Real-time visualization for Incident Commanders, including flowing of data from 3D mapping and CB monitoring sensors.
• Real-time communication between C2 systems and drones, robots and sensors for CB monitoring and sampling missions.

SCUALE consortium led by TDMS, consists of 14 partners representing 8 countries. The studies of the SCUALE project are articulated around three main themes: 
- Advanced lead-free materials and components research: carry out research for the development of advanced lead-free materials and components with physical and piezoelectric properties enabling the substitution of PZT in sonar applications. 
- Improving lead-free piezoelectric materials manufacturing processes: increase the manufacturing readiness level of the most mature lead-free piezoelectric materials and bring out one or more European industrial supplier of lead-free piezoelectric materials for sonar transducers. 
- PZT substitution in sonar transducers: increase the technology maturity of lead-free piezoelectric materials for PZT substitution in sonar applications and assess these new materials for sonar applications on representative test transducers under operational constraints. 

Also, SCUALE will undertake the development of disruptive lead-free ceramic processes such as textured ceramics and 3D printing as well as the development of disruptive fiber-optic sensing providing operational performance improvements in terms of bandwidth, system noise and weight.

Space-based Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems have become more and more performant and versatile. They are providing an ever-increasing number of services to support strategic, tactical and operational activities in security and defence. Technological developments have continuously improved performances but also lowered the costs of high-resolution systems. Over the past years, they have also made it possible to develop space solutions that answer military needs for shorter revisit periods (increased persistency), shorter end-to-end delays (system latency), new applications (e.g. night vision) or support to tactical operations.
Recent events have confirmed the important contribution of Space ISR to military operations as well as how critical reactivity and timely availability of data are. Keeping pace with the latest evolutions in Space ISR is essential for European security.
Today, several European countries operate Space ISR systems, either as national assets or under specific transnational cooperation agreements. These systems use a wide variety of traditional spaceborne sensors (optical, radar, SIGINT) and have provided European defence with an extensive experience on the use of Space ISR. Many European countries, which do not have direct access to a Space ISR system, receive space imagery through transnational cooperation.
Because the existing systems are operated independently, their revisit, persistency, reactivity and data diversity added value are limited to what each of them can offer on its own. Similarly, support at tactical level is only possible with nationally operated assets because current transnational data sharing time response is not compatible with tactical support.
The current organisation of multiple independent systems limits the capability to answer emerging needs on new applications, improved revisit, decreased latency or persistency at an affordable cost.
The Space Based Persistent ISR for Defence and Europe Reinforcement (SPIDER) project’s ambition is to provide European countries with Space ISR capabilities that are capable to answer to these new military needs in a cost-effective way.

This SPIDER proposal is a feasibility study about multi-mission affordable satellites constellations dedicated to space-based ISR for European defence. With the aim of providing:
- High reactivity, including autonomous re-tasking
- Short revisit periods
- Short end to end system latency
- Compatibility with existing national systems
- Compatibility with other European ISR initiative (e.g. CoHGI or AI for defence)

The main components of the system studied are:
1/ New self-standing small satellites constellations, able to cover a wide variety of mission: video, optical night vision, SAR, SIGINT, EM spectrum monitoring, Hyperspectral. The project considers various technological and operational options in order to achieve the system objectives, such as: non-heliosynchronous orbits, inter-satellite links, advanced on-board processing, improved data downlink capabilities… Cost efficiency will be major driver during design trade-offs.
2/ A User Service Centre, called Federation Layer, which provides end-users access to the satellites constellations from a single interface. It can also give access to other existing space systems that offer shared services. This centre supports various forms of transnational cooperation and automatically handles the sharing rules defined by each partner.

Activities will be guided by inputs from the Member States Ministries of Defence. They will set the operational requirements and use-cases, which will drive the design and Concept of Operations. The project will include:
- The preliminary design of the system, including preliminary performances analyses.
- A study of how several new technologies can contribute to better or new capabilities in space and ground systems. This will include risk reduction simulations or demonstrations.

To make sure that the designed Model is realistic, partial tests for risk reduction will be conducted at the end of the 2-year project and will allow to assess feasibility of the architectural interoperability model and its selected parameters.""",44175699,file.txt,"ATM,civil-military,information exchange,air defence,air C2,Single European Sky,interoperability",SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD,44181033101121440,101121440,EDF-2022-RA-C4ISR-AIRC2,20,0,19048832.29,"999809265,999904034,999991819,884772988,998325941,999939730,911149131,996375756,894728583,957954444,919527700,999959130,998627417,883848190,897926576,996531635,983564481,999961555,932760440,953620387",2023-12-01T00:00:00.000+0100,44181033,44173368,text/plain,2021 - 2027,SESIOP,European Defence Fund (EDF),2024-12-27T01:54:46.116+0100,"AIRBUS DEFENCE AND SPACE SAS,AALBORG UNIVERSITET,AIRBUS DEFENCE AND SPACE GMBH,ARBIT CYBER DEFENCE SYSTEMS APS,DEEP BLUE SRL,""THALES EDISOFT PORTUGAL, S.A."",UAB NOVIAN PRO,ECOLE NATIONALE DE L AVIATION CIVILE,ENERSEC TECHNOLOGY SRL,ERA AS,SXOLI IKARON,INDRA SISTEMAS SA,LEONARDO - SOCIETA PER  AZIONI,LUXTRUST SA,SPIKA TECH SL,TELEPLAN GLOBE AS,THALES HELLAS MONOPROSOPI ANONYMI ETAIREIA PARAGOGIS EMPORIAS KAI YPIRESION ILEKTRONIKOU EXOPLISMOU,THALES LAS FRANCE SAS,TEKNOLOGIAN TUTKIMUSKESKUS VTT OY,42 SOLUTIONS BV","20000890,20000875,20000873,20000875,20000922,20000990,20000944,20000890,20000994,20000872,20000902,20000883,20000922,20000945,20000883,20000974,20000902,20000890,20000885,20000973",98.81,https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/44181033/101121440/EDF,https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/44181033/101121440/EDF,18821665.29,2023-12-13T00:00:00.000+0100,2024-12-27T01:54:46.101+0100,European Defence Fund (EDF),45113611,"FRJ2,DK05,DE21,DK01,ITI4,PT17,LT01,FRJ2,RO32,CZ05,EL64,ES30,ITI4,LU00,ES30,NO08,EL64,FR10,FI1B,NL41",European Defence Fund (EDF),EDF,2024-11-25T15:23:35.884+0100

vehicles designed to operate in the sea/air interface, giving rise to a new type of unmanned craft, Unmanned WIG Vehicles. Such
vehicles could provide enormous advantages over any other locomotion means: they are extremely fast and energy efficient, capable
of very high payloads, inexpensive, long-range, do not require infrastructure or launch vehicle for departure and landing, and they
can be much more difficult to detect. Among others, the SEAWINGS solution can facilitate Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance
activities by EU Member States to increase strategic preparedness and to ensure the success of future defence-related operations and
missions.

SEAWINGS will conduct a series of complementary research, simulation and assessment activities to confirm and demonstrate the
potential capabilities of UWVs for a range of well-defined military and defence scenarios to support and enhance the EU maritime
capabilities. During the course of the project SEAWINGS will perform a combination of basic and applied research activities focused
on mechatronics, navigation, autonomy and control and sensor fusion experiments in order to establish specifications for WIG
vehicles to be successfully operated as drones. Efforts will lead to a large-scale SEAWINGS drone model and assessing it in a
representative environment. Specific objectives are: 1) Implement an architecture for the SEAWINGS platform to operate
autonomously, 2) Adapt and deliver the technological components for operational field circumstances, 3) Upgrade the operational
interface, supervision system, launch and recovery system for field trials and 4) Conduct and evaluate a series of partial field trials

vehicles could provide enormous advantages over any other locomotion means: they are extremely fast and energy efficient, capable
of very high payloads, inexpensive, long-range, do not require infrastructure or launch vehicle for departure and landing, and they
can be much more difficult to detect. Among others, the SEAWINGS solution can facilitate Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance
activities by EU Member States to increase strategic preparedness and to ensure the success of future defence-related operations and
missions.

SEAWINGS will conduct a series of complementary research, simulation and assessment activities to confirm and demonstrate the
potential capabilities of UWVs for a range of well-defined military and defence scenarios to support and enhance the EU maritime
capabilities. During the course of the project SEAWINGS will perform a combination of basic and applied research activities focused
on mechatronics, navigation, autonomy and control and sensor fusion experiments in order to establish specifications for WIG
vehicles to be successfully operated as drones. Efforts will lead to a large-scale SEAWINGS drone model and assessing it in a
representative environment. Specific objectives are: 1) Implement an architecture for the SEAWINGS platform to operate
autonomously, 2) Adapt and deliver the technological components for operational field circumstances, 3) Upgrade the operational
interface, supervision system, launch and recovery system for field trials and 4) Conduct and evaluate a series of partial field trials
according to increasing levels of difficulty. End-users will take active part in SEAWINGS implementation by providing their
requirements for the model.""",45095551,file.txt,"Drones,Sea,Air,Wing-in-Ground,Unmanned Wind-in-Ground Vehicles,Robotics,EU Defence",SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD,44181033101102763,101102763,EDF-2021-OPEN-R-SME-2,6,0,3927342.64,"954900496,999974844,999513706,890699882,988442029,888553854",2022-12-01T00:00:00.000+0100,44181033,45095543,text/plain,2021 - 2027,SEAWINGS,European Defence Fund (EDF),2024-12-26T18:00:13.605+0100,"LA PALMA RESEARCH CENTRE SL,UNIVERSIDAD POLITECNICA DE MADRID,""INESC TEC - INSTITUTO DE ENGENHARIADE SISTEMAS E COMPUTADORES, TECNOLOGIA E CIENCIA"",TRISOLARIS ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES LDA,ZANASI ALESSANDRO SRL,PORVALOR - ATIVOS DE ENGENHARIA LDA","20000883,20000883,20000990,20000990,20000922,20000990",,https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/44181033/101102763/EDF,https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/44181033/101102763/EDF,3927342.64,2022-12-07T00:00:00.000+0100,2024-12-26T18:00:13.589+0100,European Defence Fund (EDF),45297720,"ES70,ES30,PT11,PT20,ITH5,PT20",European Defence Fund (EDF),EDF,2024-10-24T13:28:54.813+0200

EDIDP-SME-2020-064-SRB, which ends after the initial prototype testing phase in Nov/2024, having so far successfully completed all milestones.
Rotary suspension technologies fit particularly well on tracked vehicles due to their compactness, robustness, and incomparable energy dissipated/space claim ratio. In the past, the constant increase in weight and high–mobility requirements have challenged the different suspension technologies.
Rotary dampers have notably increased their energy dissipation capabilities by moving from friction-based technologies to Full Hydraulic high efficiency/low maintenance rotary dampers.
As opposed to current solutions (hydropneumatics cylinders, torsion bar with mechanic or hydraulic damper, rocker actuated rotary suspension systems based on hydropneumatics cylinders) this system would be able to offer a much better performance as well as a much easier integrability. Its suspension travel to space claim required ratio will, whilst maintaining high force damping, ensure a much better vehicle mobility, performance, and product integrability. Another added advantage of the system, will be the possibility to regulate the vehicle ride height, ensuring it is always tailored to the vehicle’s specific need. The final system will also be able to operate under aggressive environments and extremely harsh temperature conditions without detriment to the system’s performance.

REACT II will bring all the progress made and the lessons learned from REACT I (awarded proposal for EDIDP-ACC-AEAC-2019). All this experience gathered is an invaluable asset to build on for the new project to be undertaken.
The REACT II solution to cover the future challenges for AEA capability will be comprised by a modular architecture-based system whose core building blocks will allow to reconfigure the system to better adapt to the needs of the mission to be performed. Some of the most important building blocks are those dedicated to AESA, DRFM, Digital Beam Forming, RAT-ECS, amongst others which will be detailed in section 8.2 (WP4).
The REACT II system solution will be capable of performing Escort jamming / Modified, Stand-Off Jamming, Stand-In Jamming, Electronic Warfare Command and Control and Cyber and Electromagnetic Activities.
Regarding the impact of REACT II on the EU MS is not only limited to their Air Forces capabilities, but also to their defence industry sector.

This concern is common to navigation applications, to Earth Observation applications and to Satellite Communication applications. RFI problems are also characterized, in the increasingly crowded space environment, by happening in any combination of location of the source of interference and the affected receiver, either in space or on Earth. Therefore, there is a growing demand to deal with RFI in a efficient and affordable way, both for civil and military use- and here is where RFSHIELD is positioned.
The main objective of RFSHIELD project is to increase the availability and performance of COMSATCOM/MILSATCOM services for military users by developing a European-made solution to protect the SatCom services from intentional and non-intentional interferences. It is the first European solution, that aims to do it in a waveform agnostic way while it is interoperable with the network equipment.
We are tackling two scenarios, CASE 1 and CASE 2, where the RFSHIELD solution is used either on-ground or space segments:
-CASE 1: On the ground platform, RFSHIELD addresses wideband communication scenarios: the solution will detect and remove the interference on ground infrastructure (on-camp remote terminals and hub side) in military X, Ku, and Ka bands. The interferers are both external (jamming, radar or other terrestrial sources), or from the own defense unit (own ECM, ECCM systems)
-CASE 2: On the space segment, RFSHIELD aims to protect a satellite payload working on UHF frequency with narrowband signals, mainly used for critical communications and positioning service. We address interference from other external devices. The objective is to filter/remove interference signals transmitting outside and within the working channels (by blanking a limited part of the spectrum to eliminate stronger interferers).""",en,RF INTERFERENCE REMOVAL FOR MILITARY SERVICES BASED ON SPACES LINK,16458C4591BBEDA79FC7A1EC808CD1AE61D81959F1BFE54FA456780C85732B2D,"""The problems derived from manmade RF interference (RFI), whether generated intentionally or not, remain one of the main concerns of the space industry.

process capacity and IMINT analysts.
IntSen2 aims at researching a disruptive change, using Artificial Intelligence to develop a concept of application for an IMINT service,
from a reactive service design to a proactive service design. And it does so by basing the research and proposed solutions exclusively
on European assets in order to support EU operational autonomy. This proposal, therefore, will design a system to fully automatize
the IMINT workflow, consisting of: i) Automatic Acquisition, ii) Automatic Pre-processing; iii) (Key Challenge) Automatic Extraction, iv)
Automatic report generation; v) Automatic Dashboard management.
Two technologies using Artificial Intelligence lie at the core of the solution that IntSen2 proposes:
- Super-resolution: Improving the resolution of imagery by a factor of 4 allows imagery from Sentinel satellites to provide
value in security scenarios.
- Automatic Extraction: Applying AI based extraction techniques to super-resolved Sentinel imagery can unlock the use of all
operational potential of Sentinel for security scenarios.
Under this context, IntSen2 appears as the first urgent step for creating the infrastructures that the EC needs for obtaining an
autonomous and independent intelligence that can face the rise of capabilities of major third countries and contribute to a Common

At the ground combat level, major threats are modern main battle tanks that apply active protection systems and improved explosive reactive armour, as well as infrastructures that integrate high-performance concrete. 

These threats will become even more challenging: besides Russia, China will soon possess similar systems, which will also become more present in North Africa and the Middle East in the coming years. 

New warhead technologies are a must-have for the armed forces of EU Member States to keep their lead and defeat these threats. NEWHEAT aims to improve the performance of conventional shaped charge by integrating new high explosive, new liner materials and new geometries. To go beyond the State-of-the-Art and address future challenges, NEWHEAT will also focus on the development of new concepts and demonstrators for warheads: 
- Explosively Formed Projectiles 
- Multi-Liner Explosively Formed Projectiles 
- Slow Stretching Jet Shaped Charges

NEWHEAT will gather the background and know-how of 8 partners and 5 subcontractors (including one SME, one mid-cap, 5 large companies and 6 RTO) from 7 countries to develop, design and test these new concepts. This ambitious research project, implemented over 36 months, represents an unprecedented opportunity for the partners to enforce cross-border cooperation and pave the way for new cooperation, development actions, and industrialization after the end of the project.

LATACC will improve coalitions collaborative capabilities from Brigade command post down to combat vehicles, dismounted soldier and unmanned assets.
LATACC adapts and enhances legacy systems, develops new technologies and integrates them into a common European framework based on an open middleware architecture. LATACC interfaces with national legacy Vetronics, as well as Battle Management Systems, other domains (air, space, cyber) and civilian systems based on an standardized approach (such as FMN or NGVA). Artificial Intelligence, Mission Optimization and Collaboration services are at the core of LATACC.
The project activities, over a period of 3 years, consist of (i) studies to analyse European User requirements and common operational scenarios, existing standards and key enabling technologies and define an open architecture and its key components: core and COI services, integration of multiple legacies and emerging assets; (ii) design of the solution’s key components and (iii) prototyping and demoing in interconnected industrial labs as well as a in real-world to validate the operational benefits.
LATACC involves 32 participants and 2 subcontractors from 13 countries combining large defence companies supplying land tactical combat legacy systems, SMEs, midcaps and research institutes.

objective is to increase air observation coverage capacity through an affordable permanent detection of crossing events on a linear
surface 10 km x 500 km wide when the others rare and expensive air observation assets are unavailable, either dedicated to more
critical mission or too expensive to be acquired by governments.
The SMEs of the consortium will strengthen their ability to provide assets for security and defence purpose in these critical capacities:
- Enhanced image processing algorithms for light UAV on-board processing and automated event detection - Enhanced SIGINT
sensors and on-board processing to detect and localize radio emitters and merge info with image processing to improve the
identification of targets
- Affordable resilient UAVs’ swarm flight based on innovative solutions for UHF communication and flight management system
The architecture and the specification of the project will also ensure the ability of the solution to be easily deployed in the current
C4ISR environment by using EU & NATO standards.
MALE UAVs are highly effective but have a huge Total Cost of Ownership with expensive and time-consuming Operation &
Maintenance. That reduces the affordability of these capacities and leads to use these assets only for anticipation and high added
value targets or stakes. Therefore, it is difficult to commit UAVs capacity to provide air observation in support of less strategic
missions or area even if by doing so you could increase force protection and decrease collateral damages. ALTISS fills the gap
between MALE UAVs and Mini-Drones Reconnaissance Systems. It gives the ability to deploy permanent forward air observation

With the successful implementation of the project the impact delivers unprecedented (1) technological enablers for simultaneous high stealth and high maneuverability aircraft concepts, (2) elevation of the state-of-the-art pneumatic as well as all electric powered fluidic actuators and (3) acquisition of integration knowledge, de-risked and verified by means of flight assessment on a representative full scale aircraft structure.

To overcome design conflicts between stealthiness and maneuverability of military aircraft, the FACELIFT project proposes the use of fluidic actuators. Thereby, smaller stabilising and control surfaces can be used for an equal or better performance in terms of maneuverability. Two types of actuators will be considered: sweeping jets and synthetic jets.

It is expected that the implementation of closed-loop controlled fluidic actuators will deliver a 50 % decrease of the Radar Cross Section originating from a control surface for the same maneuverability by area reduction. Considering stabilising surfaces, such as a fin, it is expected that the area may be halved, which on the aircraft level may contribute up to a 30 % reduction of the RCS. By using synthetic jet actuators, the IR signature will not be impacted due to its electric power source.

The FACELIFT consortium consists of 3 SME partners from 3 different member states (Cedrat Technologies (FR), NAVASTO (DE) and ESC DEFENCE (CZ) and a RTO (ONERA (FR)).

By using synthetic jet actuators, the IR signature will not be impacted due to its electric power source.

The FACELIFT consortium consists of 3 SME partners from 3 different member states (Cedrat Technologies (FR), NAVASTO (DE) and ESC DEFENCE (CZ) and a RTO (ONERA (FR)).

Therefore, there is an urgent need for cybersecurity services to ensure an appropriate level of control and prevention to reduce the adversarial attack surface.

The best solution to this challenge appears to be to unite the forces of European partners and to translate this union into a common European federated framework for cyber physical testing with a common architecture and shared tool set.

This strategy includes a common way of orchestrating tests from different European cyber range environments, each specialized on certain types of cyber-attacks on specific systems, products or components. The availability of common services and access to an almost unlimited number of scenarios, enables partners to establish new test sites tailored to their expertise. 

The federation of these capabilities across Europe will ensure an improved and coordinated cyber security focus, enhance the performance and productivity, and reduce risk and cost compared to stand alone Cyber range environments. More so, the common environment will stimulate to collaboration in new dimensions absolutely indispensable to counter future cyber threats.

The Federated Advanced Cyber physical Test range project (FACT) will deliver a new unprecedented European capability for cyber physical testing and verification of equipment.

This FACT capability will be based on two disruptive and unique assets: an advanced cyber physical test range capability and a European wide federated approach.

Therefore, the FACT project is well positioned to address capability gaps identified at the EU level and positively contribute to the implementation of several priorities, while enabling an enhanced overall level of protection of a wide range of systems, both within and outside of the European Defence.

The RESILIENCE project aims to build a European collaborative ecosystem against current or future CBRN threats, including research institutes, universities, RTOs, hospitals, industries, mid-caps and SMEs. It will be based on a multiannual action plan of research and development activities established in consultation with relevant authorities leading to effective and efficient medical countermeasures. Such countermeasures would then be industrialized, transferred and used by the armed forces for improving EU preparedness for CBRN military crises and fostering EU sovereignty.  
The main concept of the RESILIENCE multiannual action plan is based on a time-related deployment of armed forces in a theatre of operations where multiple health conditions requiring MCMs may occur. The action plan is organized around three main pillars of MCMs: Diagnosis, Prevention/Prophylaxis and Treatment which will respond to chemical (nerve agents, yperite, ricin and abrin), biological (pox viruses, viral hemorrhagic fevers, Y. pestis, B. anthracis, B. pseudo mallei and Botulinum toxins) and radiological and nuclear threats. Innovative diagnostic tools (e.g., on-field tools), novel vaccines (e.g., antibody-based, vaccine with high cross orthopox protection efficacy) and more efficient treatments (e.g., decorporating agents, reactivators of cholinesterases, phage therapy) will be developed.
By gathering a critical mass of European players who will collaborate to provide European armed forces with novel efficient MCMs, RESILIENCE will contribute to strengthening the autonomy of the European sovereignty, to developing EU autonomous industrial segments and to maintaining the operational capacity of soldiers in the field.""",en,"""European Strategic alliance for research, development and innovation on medical countermeasures against CBRN threats""",80D49767C41FFE17A574FDFCE2C36343AFBB8EE0288FDD9DF12128AA128BBE6A,"""The EU is facing security challenges as CBRN threats especially of intended origin.

The project will analyze use cases requirements and constraints, and combine these towards modular architectures based on future chiplets. Elementary technological bricks such as advanced substrate down to 15µm L/S, wafer level packaging, Die to Die interconnect IP will be developed to build a “packaging toolbox”. Design engineering concerns will be addressed to identify the design flow, the design and assembly rules to build a “Physical Design Kit”. Five technology demonstrators will be designed, manufactured and tested to prequalify the toolbox. 
The aim is to develop in Europe OSAT and technology providers in the field of advanced packaging serving defence needs. These ambitious goals are achievable because the partners will bring advanced technologies i.e. advanced wafer level packaging from IZM, die-to-die interconnect from Extoll, new interposer for RF from UMS, heterogeneous integration packaging and test from Synergie CAD.

Further, application of a SPAD array will reduce data acquisition time and therefore enables application in military relevant dynamic scenarios. We intend to bring the current technology readiness level (TRL) of 2/3 to TRL 5.""",45095551,file.txt,"image formation,reconstruction methods,non-line-of-sight,spads,swir",SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD,44181033101103242,101103242,EDF-2021-DIS-RDIS-NLOS-2,6,0,8409382.22,"999898214,999610124,999923240,999879881,999984059,999552700",2022-12-01T00:00:00.000+0100,44181033,45095543,text/plain,2021 - 2027,ENLIGHTEN,European Defence Fund (EDF),2024-12-26T18:31:13.950+0100,"UNIVERSIDAD DE ZARAGOZA,INSTITUT FRANCO-ALLEMAND DE RECHERCHES DE SAINT LOUIS,UNIVERZA V LJUBLJANI,POLITECNICO DI MILANO,FRAUNHOFER GESELLSCHAFT ZUR FORDERUNG DER ANGEWANDTEN FORSCHUNG EV,MICRO PHOTON DEVICES SRL","20000883,20000890,20001004,20000922,20000873,20000922",,https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/44181033/101103242/EDF,https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/44181033/101103242/EDF,8409382.22,2022-12-07T00:00:00.000+0100,2024-12-26T18:31:13.936+0100,European Defence Fund (EDF),45297828,"ES24,FRF1,SI04,ITC4,DE21,ITH1",European Defence Fund (EDF),EDF,

The EU Council Conclusions on the EU Space Strategy for Security and Defence underscore the importance of Space Domain Awareness (SDA) for national sovereignty and encourage sharing SDA information among Member States. EMISSARY aligns with these conclusions, aiming to support the establishment of a complete and independent European military SSA value-chain. 

EMISSARY’s value proposition focuses on four interconnected beacons: sovereignty in detection, tracking, and characterization of space objects; shared European recognized space picture to sMS based on enhanced SSA data; integration into the international landscape; and establishing a robust European data security policy. It emphasizes the development of a network of advanced sensors and a military SSA Command and Control (C2) software to process and circulate data, ensuring national and European sovereignty while fostering EDTIB collaboration.

The project involves government agencies, industries, SME and midcaps, scientific communities and RTOs, and integrating international initiatives and innovative technologies. It encompasses 51 partners from 13 Member States, 12 of which has signed the Letter of Intent, ensuring continuity and expansion of expertise from previous projects like INTEGRAL and SAURON. EMISSARY aims to achieve a prototyping, demonstration and qualification stage for a large set of the technologies developed, reflecting a commitment to advancing European military SSA capabilities, ensuring security and sustainability in space, and enhancing Europe's strategic autonomy and international competitiveness in the space domain.

(1) a coherent set of components that covers the full data lifecycle from data management (collection, processing, storage and indexing) to CIW-intelligence (situation awareness, capitalisation of threats and known actors, mission management and countermeasures)
(2) an Interoperability Framework and its associated TestBed which define and validate data exchanges and interfaces between components to ensure the constitution of operational toolchains
(3) a Store able to host components and their associated metadata allowing capitalisation within EU stakeholders while avoiding unnecessary duplication of work
 
Emerging technologies, notably based on AI, will be explored with respect to current standards and regulations, social and cultural impacts; and ethics considerations. Three scenarios and use cases will support the design of the proposed EUCINF toolbox, including tools, methods, data, and common functions for integration in defence systems such as i.a. standards, interoperability, trustworthiness, and ethics as addressed in dedicated WPs. It will be based on EU-owned solutions/technologies. An End User Group will be set and integrated in an Agile Approach.

EUCINF benefits from a well-balanced consortium with key European capabilities and skills: European champions in AI, platform manufacturers, effectors, systems developers covering the whole spectrum of CIW related applications.""",44175699,file.txt,"Information warfare,Disinformation,interoperable tools,Operational Multi-domain,Situation Awareness,Countermeasures,Cognitive warfare,Hybrid warfare,Artificial Intelligence,Standardisation",SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD,44181033101121418,101121418,EDF-2022-DA-CYBER-CIWT,22,0,41188736.82,"999809265,952774935,999959130,998627417,999584128,997511626,893799323,964532402,999754363,881080974,885411151,917066131,999778322,996539686,999991819,884650089,885298922,884675794,906314360,941331651,999974844,999844282",2023-12-01T00:00:00.000+0100,44181033,45095537,text/plain,2021 - 2027,EUCINF,European Defence Fund (EDF),2024-12-27T01:54:40.527+0100,"AIRBUS DEFENCE AND SPACE SAS,AIRBUS CYBERSECURITY SAS,INDRA SISTEMAS SA,LEONARDO - SOCIETA PER  AZIONI,AIT AUSTRIAN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY GMBH,HENSOLDT ANALYTICS GMBH,FORWARD GLOBAL,APPROACH BELGIUM SA,CYBERNETICA AS,CYEX KORLATOLT FELELOSSEGU TARSASAG,ECLECTICIQ BV,EIGHT BELLS LTD,SPACE HELLAS ANONYMI ETAIREIA SYSTIMATA KAI YPIRESIES TILEPIKOINONIONPLIROFORIKIS ASFALEIAS - IDIOTIKI EPICHEIRISI PAROCHIS YPERISION ASFA,TILDE SIA,AIRBUS DEFENCE AND SPACE GMBH,ANOZRWAY,BLOOM,SAHAR,STORYZY,BV TECH SPA,UNIVERSIDAD POLITECNICA DE MADRID,UNIVERSIDAD DE MURCIA","20000890,20000890,20000883,20000922,20000832,20000832,20000839,20000839,20000880,20000913,20000973,20000871,20000902,20000946,20000873,20000890,20000890,20000890,20000890,20000922,20000883,20000883",80.12,https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/44181033/101121418/EDF,https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/44181033/101121418/EDF,32999997.2,2023-12-11T00:00:00.000+0100,2024-12-27T01:54:40.509+0100,European Defence Fund (EDF),45113716,"FRJ2,FR10,ES30,ITI4,AT13,AT13,BE10,BE31,EE00,HU11,NL32,CY00,EL64,LV00,DE21,FRH0,FR10,FR10,FR10,ITC4,ES30,ES62",European Defence Fund (EDF),EDF,2024-11-06T19:26:59.384+0100

In this EPW proposal the consortium will focus on the Study and Design phases in the development process for a multi-layered security and resiliency solution that consists of an EU protected waveform standard, software defined baseband equipment and 
adjacent security technologies. Under the umbrella of the adjacent security technologies are EPW considerations for on-board processing satellites as well as study and design work on next-gen satellite terminals for on-the-move applications (e.g. UAVs), small satellites and upcoming technologies such as 5G, Hybrid networks, etc.). The main objective is to present the military end-user with an innovative end-to-end secure solution for seamless satellite communications at maximum information assurance. 
The European Protected Waveform is built around four corner stones: efficient, secure, affordable and interoperable satellite communications and will be accessible to small, mid-sized and large European nations seeking to embrace today’s and future challenges related to increased throughput demand over satellite, dispersed operations, mobility and new security threats.

Currently, military operations face significant downtimes due to maintenance requirements of equipment, vehicles, and other critical assets, heavily relying on repair and spare parts supply. By leveraging metal AM technologies, the project seeks to enable rapid response in manufacturing metallic spare parts and repairing critical components, regardless of the operational location.
The EU defence sector has yet to fully exploit the potential of AM technologies, mainly due to the lack of highly skilled personnel available during military deployments. DISCMAM addresses this challenge by developing a secure and disruptive digital thread, facilitating remote assistance for repair and spare parts manufacturing in military field operations.
Through two demonstrative use cases utilizing Powder Bed Fusion and Directed Energy Deposition Laser-based technologies, DISCMAM will validate its innovative solution. The digital thread will establish an effective digital supply chain for on-site maintenance within the EU defence sector.
The project brings together new actors in defence research and innovation, laying the foundation for an innovative business model that enables remote-assisted on-site maintenance operations. DISCMAM will provide autonomy to repair damaged components and manufacture spare parts through secure communication pathways. Key benefits include eliminating the need for AM highly specialized operators/technicians on-site, reducing supply time, shortages, and spare parts costs, minimizing non-usage time of critical assets, and optimizing on-site stocks and digital inventory.

To ensure superiority, novel methods, concepts and multi-sensor platforms are needed for enhanced, covert target sensing and increased situational awareness. CASSATA intends to provide improvements in a whole range of Covert Sensing domains: 
1/ CASSATA will implement innovative technologies to improve the covertness of optronics sensors as well as their capabilities of detection, tracking, classification and identification 
2/ To CASSATA will study three types of sensors (Acoustic/seismic networks for area surveillance, MEMS based acoustic sensors and Opto-acoustic sensors) that contribute to the network of sensors providing coverage for previously undetectable targets in challenging environments 
3/ CASSATA will implement innovative technologies and/or upgrade current technologies to provide covert RF sensors (radar and RF Direction Finding) or to improve their capabilities of detection and tracking for vehicles, sea surface targets, air targets (from low size drone to high speed targets). 
4/ In CASSATA, the use of new generation techniques (data fusion and collaboration techniques, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning) will be applied to maximize the ISR capabilities of the sensing systems themselves, as well as those of the multi-sensing platforms/ Techniques, methodologies and solutions studied and designed in CASSATA will be tested and validated in appropriate simulation and/or laboratory environment following a use-case oriented approach. To achieve its objectives, CASSATA will unleash a large, inclusive & industry-driven consortium to provide more accurate and effective covert sensing solutions:

To ensure superiority, novel methods, concepts and multi-sensor platforms are needed for enhanced, covert target sensing and increased situational awareness. CASSATA intends to provide improvements in a whole range of Covert Sensing domains: 
1/ CASSATA will implement innovative technologies to improve the covertness of optronics sensors as well as their capabilities of detection, tracking, classification and identification 
2/ To CASSATA will study three types of sensors (Acoustic/seismic networks for area surveillance, MEMS based acoustic sensors and Opto-acoustic sensors) that contribute to the network of sensors providing coverage for previously undetectable targets in challenging environments 
3/ CASSATA will implement innovative technologies and/or upgrade current technologies to provide covert RF sensors (radar and RF Direction Finding) or to improve their capabilities of detection and tracking for vehicles, sea surface targets, air targets (from low size drone to high speed targets). 
4/ In CASSATA, the use of new generation techniques (data fusion and collaboration techniques, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning) will be applied to maximize the ISR capabilities of the sensing systems themselves, as well as those of the multi-sensing platforms/ Techniques, methodologies and solutions studied and designed in CASSATA will be tested and validated in appropriate simulation and/or laboratory environment following a use-case oriented approach. To achieve its objectives, CASSATA will unleash a large, inclusive & industry-driven consortium to provide more accurate and effective covert sensing solutions:

The concept of AIDEDeX relies on the strong foundations of the on-going project AIDED (https://aided-padr.eu/) in which the consortium is carrying out the technology development, offering a solid base for an highly reliable platform in AIDEDeX. The main focus is on the automated detection of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) using Artificial Intelligence techniques on data collected from a large suite of sensors such as Electro-Magnetic Inference (EMI), Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR), X-Ray Backscatter Imaging (XRB), Raman Spectrometer, Infrared Cameras, Multispectral Cameras and Chemical. This set of sensors, or a combination of them, allows to determine the position and type of the IED and landmines with a maximum accuracy while minimising every risk. 

A fleet of mixed Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV) and Aerial (UAV) will be able to operate in different challenges and scenarios, from open space fields to more risky closed environments and urban scenarios, of increasing interest for security in cities. The system will be able to plan the mission in complete autonomy, receiving just the perimeter of the area to explore. One of the UGV will also be equipped with a robotic arm for manipulation of the IED with different manipulation systems, such as pliers with force feedback to carefully grab the object, scissors to cut wires and air-compressed gun to clean eventual dust or cover on the ordnance. The core idea of this approach is to provide a fully autonomous intelligent system, with capabilities of merging and analysing data from heterogeneous sensors and decisional autonomy to operate on the environment, with performances that overcome the more consolidated approach of human operator and teleoperated robot. It would allow to overcome classical issues as environments with telecommunication denial and intrinsic difficulties in operating several robots of different dimensions and with different locomotion systems, while increasing at the same time the capacity of the operator to control the system, using hybrid interfaces between teleoperation and semi-autonomous algorithms. 

The innovations resulting from the project include a complete, reliable robotics solution (mission planning, deploying, monitoring) compatible with a large range of applications. Improved AI and data fusion techniques provide a better understanding of the environment, enabling more robust autonomous operations such as optimal path planning in difficult conditions and complex robotic arm manipulation for removing debris covering the IEDs for improved measurement with sensors.""",en,Artificial Intelligence for Detection of Explosive Devices - Extended,15FF94CCC327B88247C7E2A026227779CF14106C654A28BC70530C465F22EC70,"""AIDEDeX (Artificial Intelligence for Detection of Explosive Ordnance Extended) aims to provide a baseline for advanced and mature research for multi-robotic systems with State of the Art sensors and Artificial Intelligence Algorithms for the detection and classification of IEDs (Improvised Explosive Devices), EOs (Explosive Ordnance) and Landmines.

national level and abroad. Small- and mini-class UAS are compact, agile and easy to deploy platforms that have been deployed in a
wide range of scenarios, consistently contributing to intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions, and considerably
reducing the threat to human life in high-risk operations. The most critical factor that limits their application is determined by its
payload carrying capacity. Small class UAS can transport only a few kilos, which makes them unfit for the heavy electro-optic systems
necessary for target designation missions.
Recent developments in material science, additive manufacturing and laser technology have created the necessary conditions for the

The project proposes the development of a miniature LTD optimised for integration into a mini-UAV unit. State-of-the-art diodepumped solid-state laser technology and athermal optical design will be used to obtain a low SWaP-C system with optical output
fully compliant with NATO STANAG 3733, enabling accurate long-range designation and targeting. Further reduction of the LTD’s
size and weight will be achieved by innovative mechanical design of the laser household and its optical system supports. These
complex and lightweight structures will be manufactured by selective laser melting of lightweight metal alloys.
These downsized LTD devices would comply with the stringent payload size requirements of small class UAV without any decrease in
their performance. This would allow small- and mini-class UAS to be able to perform target designation activities and extend their

national level and abroad. Small- and mini-class UAS are compact, agile and easy to deploy platforms that have been deployed in a
wide range of scenarios, consistently contributing to intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions, and considerably
reducing the threat to human life in high-risk operations. The most critical factor that limits their application is determined by its
payload carrying capacity. Small class UAS can transport only a few kilos, which makes them unfit for the heavy electro-optic systems
necessary for target designation missions.
Recent developments in material science, additive manufacturing and laser technology have created the necessary conditions for the
development of a new generation of laser target designator systems (LTD).

ALADAN, a 42-month project, will design and develop a disruptive framework of development for AI-based language solutions for defence applications (i.e., spoken language identification, speech recognition, spoken term search, and text and speech translation), that will rely mainly on the use of non confidential data for training to target in-domain data using only a small amount of application-specific data for validation. It will enable the development of an in-domain solution within 6 months, with significantly reduced associated costs and delay.

This makes it capable of assuming target acquisition tasks from larger UAVs at a significantly reduced cost.""",45095551,file.txt,"Mini,UAV,ISTAR,VTOL",SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD,44181033101168111,101168111,EDF-2023-LS-DA-SME-NT,3,0,4521399.93,"881995878,888688781,940514426",2024-12-01T00:00:00.000+0100,44181033,45095543,text/plain,2021 - 2027,MPortISTAR,European Defence Fund (EDF),2025-01-10T12:52:09.795+0100,"SIA 'ORIGIN ROBOTICS',AKTYVUS PHOTONICS UAB,LEOSYS LASER AND ELECTRO-OPTIC SYSTEMS GMBH","20000946,20000944,20000873",,https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/44181033/101168111/EDF,https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/44181033/101168111/EDF,4521399.93,2024-11-23T00:00:00.000+0100,2025-01-10T12:52:09.781+0100,European Defence Fund (EDF),46029443,"LV00,LT01,DE12",European Defence Fund (EDF),EDF,2025-01-10T12:52:09.795+0100

Recently, there is a growing interest in developing Hybrid Autonomous Unmanned Vehicles (HAUVs) that are capable of air-water trans-media continuous and uninterrupted motion and performance.

The main idea of PASITHEA project is to develop a new design combining the well-known UAV’s and UUV’s technologies into a multi-technology Hybrid Unmanned Vehicle, which can fly, hover in the air and sail, hover under the water, whilst having the ability to repeat air/water trans-media transitions.

The HAUV will be able to be launched and recovered from platforms/units operated and controlled by land, sea (surface/underwater) and air. The project includes the design of a high-level control, command, communication, and intelligence (C3I) system. The carrier vessel/unit can also be embedded with point-to-multipoint networking through the HAUV, meaning that after it releases the HAUV, the system can communicate and relay data with friendly forces operating nearby.

The drone will be designed to return to the operator or to an indicated/preset position either manually, autonomously or combined using an advanced mission planning subsystem. The fact that it is released from underwater means it could will not necessarily be expendable, but recoverable from the underwater mother carrier.

The idea of the projected was based on the fact that recent naval operations in various areas were carried out successfully in a joint environment in which much useful information was generated by unmanned aerial and underwater vehicles. Through these experiences, operators have gained insight into the nature of more complex threats and how they are dealt with to assure successful and effective military operations. Furthermore, vital coast-line infrastructures, as well as inland infrastructures must be defended against threats—some “asymmetric” and some sophisticated—which can be either marine or aerial in nature. These threats are often characterized by their mobility and may be attempted over extended periods of time. Thus, surveillance must take place over wide areas and operate over long time periods, which can have increased risks and wearing/fatigue for the personnel involved. The possible costs and risks involved make strong arguments for the expanded use of unmanned vehicles in modern operations.

Attracted by the prospect of lower unit cost and risk of unmanned vehicles compared to manned vehicles, all the Services have been actively using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs), unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), and unmanned undersea vehicles (UUVs). Based on the operational results, it has become widely suggested that unmanned vehicle systems can be assigned for many operational tasks. Since the operational capability and military worth of unmanned vehicles has been demonstrated in recent military operations, it is essential to exploit and develop on existing capabilities. It is deemed important to develop critical autonomous vehicle-related technologies that are considered essential to the accomplishment of future multidiscipline naval missions.

The concept of the PASITHEA application and the derived relevant technologies have not been combinedly applied in the European defence sector previously. The PASITHEA concept has the potential not only to significantly alter the way that defence forces operate, but to potentially be applied in other domains as well.

The project aims to provide the operators with a strategic advantage, enhancing military multidiscipline operations. In this respect, different application scenarios / concepts can be envisaged.
However, technical challenges where research is needed to develop the envisaged system must be faced.

The project’s scope is to:

•	Introduce a new combined technology to enhance military multidiscipline operations capable for utilization from all scale of a force formation (from task unit to task force)
•	Optimize decisio
