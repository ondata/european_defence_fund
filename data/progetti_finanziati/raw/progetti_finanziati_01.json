“ODIN’S EYE II” (multinatiOnal Development INitiative for a Space-based missilE earlY-warning architecturE II) features a multi-national and distributed architecture of layered space-borne sensors for hypersonic & ballistic missile early warning and tracking and an interoperable ground infrastructure.\nODIN’S EYE II will mainly focus on the following targets:\n•\tA SBMEW Architecture and CONOPS maturation, aiming to elaborate and consolidate SBMEW architecture and its pillars for joint missions;\n•\tThe development of an End-to-End SBMEW simulator;\n•\tBreadboards and technology de-risking activities, aimed to increase the maturity of key components, whose development may represent a critical path on the development plans.\nThe project, coordinated by OHB System in Germany, is built on the successful consortium (34 partners from 12 Member States) currently in place for the EDIDP 2020 ODIN’S EYE feasibility study. The consortium underpinning this follow-on project (comprised of 43 partners from 14 Member States and 7 subcontractors) will continue to support a balanced geographical (as well as geopolitical) distribution of partners across European Member States and associated countries.\nThe project is committed to leverage and consolidate collaborative efforts by Member States by developing a common Space-Based Missile Early Warning capability to respond. The system will also serve as the Early Warning pillar of the PESCO TWISTER project.\nFinally, ODIN’S EYE will provide an architecture that is coherent, complementary and interoperable with other systems, including non-EU systems (e.g. NATO systems)."],"typeOfMGAs":["44175699"],"freeKeywords":["Early-warning"," surveillance"," tracking"," cueing"," intelligence"," SSA"," SST"," missile defence"," satellites"," collaborative systems"," CONOPS"," resilience"," data processing"," AI"," technology de-risking"," simulation"],"DATASOURCE":["SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD"],"subProgramme":[],"overallBudget":["96595563.01"],"pics":["989360037","920737969","999809265","898635452","932228201","972664300","952545239","998381813","999981731","911149131","999984059","999905004","999951758","999967084","999694708","999959130","996235688","904156207","903174373","998627417","936720271","998552824","999987066","999994438","885074270","990406085","899285837","998945674","924631840","918136526","999908205","999488195","999939051","999958936","999961555","999480241","999988909","999630009","891438440","898508382","999653095","990040007","997545285"],"topicDescription":[],"typeOfActions":["45095537"],"es_ContentType":["text/plain"],"programmePeriod":["2021 - 2027"],"programmes":["European Defence Fund (EDF)"],"countries":["20000873","20000873","20000890","20000873","20000890","20000832","20000883","20000873","20000873","20000944","20000873","20000883","20000873","20000873","20000922","20000883","20000902","20000885","20000974","20000922","20000890","20000890","20000973","20000890","20000974","20000973","20000883","20000839","20000873","20000986","20000890","20000922","20000922","20000875","20000890","20000973","20000973","20000873","20000873","20000902","20001001","20000922","20000873"],"esST_URL":["https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/44181033/101121453/EDF"],"ecSignatureDate":["2023-12-13T00:00:00.000+0100"],"esDA_QueueDate":["2024-12-27T01:54:49.783+0100"],"topicId":["45113641"],"programAbbreviation":["EDF"],"projectId":["101121453"],"startDate":["2024-09-04T01:00:00.000+0200"],"status":["Ongoing"],"subTypeOfAction":[],"typeOfAction":["EDF Development Actions"],"projectObjective":["Growing missile threats at the European borders, in the Asia-Pacific and in the Middle East and the strong dependency on third-party systems (i.e. sensors and interceptors) are driving the need of several European countries to steer towards sovereign solutions for early detection and tracking of ballistic missiles, hypersonic gliders and ASAT missiles.\nThe system studied in the frame of the project “ODIN’S EYE II” (multinatiOnal Development INitiative for a Space-based missilE earlY-warning architecturE II) features a multi-national and distributed architecture of layered space-borne sensors for hypersonic & ballistic missile early warning and tracking and an interoperable ground infrastructure.\nODIN’S EYE II will mainly focus on the following targets:\n•\tA SBMEW Architecture and CONOPS maturation, aiming to elaborate and consolidate SBMEW architecture and its pillars for joint missions;\n•\tThe development of an End-to-End SBMEW simulator;\n•\tBreadboards and technology de-risking activities, aimed to increase the maturity of key components, whose development may represent a critical path on the development plans.\nThe project, coordinated by OHB System in Germany, is built on the successful consortium (34 partners from 12 Member States) currently in place for the EDIDP 2020 ODIN’S EYE feasibility study.

the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing effects on society and the economy, there has been a significant increase in concerns about the possibility that malicious actors could return to

They are providing an ever-increasing number of services to support strategic, tactical and operational activities in security and defence. Technological developments have continuously improved performances but also lowered the costs of high-resolution systems. Over the past years, they have also made it possible to develop space solutions that answer military needs for shorter revisit periods (increased persistency), shorter end-to-end delays (system latency), new applications (e.g. night vision) or support to tactical operations.\nRecent events have confirmed the important contribution of Space ISR to military operations as well as how critical reactivity and timely availability of data are. Keeping pace with the latest evolutions in Space ISR is essential for European security.\nToday, several European countries operate Space ISR systems, either as national assets or under specific transnational cooperation agreements. These systems use a wide variety of traditional spaceborne sensors (optical, radar, SIGINT) and have provided European defence with an extensive experience on the use of Space ISR. Many European countries, which do not have direct access to a Space ISR system, receive space imagery through transnational cooperation.\nBecause the existing systems are operated independently, their revisit, persistency, reactivity and data diversity added value are limited to what each of them can offer on its own. Similarly, support at tactical level is only possible with nationally operated assets because current transnational data sharing time response is not compatible with tactical support.\nThe current organisation of multiple independent systems limits the capability to answer emerging needs on new applications, improved revisit, decreased latency or persistency at an affordable cost.\nThe Space Based Persistent ISR for Defence and Europe Reinforcement (SPIDER) project’s ambition is to provide European countries with Space ISR capabilities that are capable to answer to these new military needs in a cost-effective way.\n\nThis SPIDER proposal is a feasibility study about multi-mission affordable satellites constellations dedicated to space-based ISR for European defence. With the aim of providing:\n- High reactivity, including autonomous re-tasking\n- Short revisit periods\n- Short end to end system latency\n- Compatibility with existing national systems\n- Compatibility with other European ISR initiative (e.g. CoHGI or AI for defence)\n\nThe main components of the system studied are:\n1/ New self-standing small satellites constellations, able to cover a wide variety of mission: video, optical night vision, SAR, SIGINT, EM spectrum monitoring, Hyperspectral. The project considers various technological and operational options in order to achieve the system objectives, such as: non-heliosynchronous orbits, inter-satellite links, advanced on-board processing, improved data downlink capabilities… Cost efficiency will be major driver during design trade-offs.\n2/ A User Service Centre, called Federation Layer, which provides end-users access to the satellites constellations from a single interface. It can also give access to other existing space systems that offer shared services. This centre supports various forms of transnational cooperation and automatically handles the sharing rules defined by each partner.\n\nActivities will be guided by inputs from the Member States Ministries of Defence.

They are providing an ever-increasing number of services to support strategic, tactical and operational activities in security and defence. Technological developments have continuously improved performances but also lowered the costs of high-resolution systems. Over the past years, they have also made it possible to develop space solutions that answer military needs for shorter revisit periods (increased persistency), shorter end-to-end delays (system latency), new applications (e.g. night vision) or support to tactical operations.\nRecent events have confirmed the important contribution of Space ISR to military operations as well as how critical reactivity and timely availability of data are. Keeping pace with the latest evolutions in Space ISR is essential for European security.\nToday, several European countries operate Space ISR systems, either as national assets or under specific transnational cooperation agreements. These systems use a wide variety of traditional spaceborne sensors (optical, radar, SIGINT) and have provided European defence with an extensive experience on the use of Space ISR. Many European countries, which do not have direct access to a Space ISR system, receive space imagery through transnational cooperation.\nBecause the existing systems are operated independently, their revisit, persistency, reactivity and data diversity added value are limited to what each of them can offer on its own. Similarly, support at tactical level is only possible with nationally operated assets because current transnational data sharing time response is not compatible with tactical support.\nThe current organisation of multiple independent systems limits the capability to answer emerging needs on new applications, improved revisit, decreased latency or persistency at an affordable cost.\nThe Space Based Persistent ISR for Defence and Europe Reinforcement (SPIDER) project’s ambition is to provide European countries with Space ISR capabilities that are capable to answer to these new military needs in a cost-effective way.\n\nThis SPIDER proposal is a feasibility study about multi-mission affordable satellites constellations dedicated to space-based ISR for European defence. With the aim of providing:\n- High reactivity, including autonomous re-tasking\n- Short revisit periods\n- Short end to end system latency\n- Compatibility with existing national systems\n- Compatibility with other European ISR initiative (e.g. CoHGI or AI for defence)\n\nThe main components of the system studied are:\n1/ New self-standing small satellites constellations, able to cover a wide variety of mission: video, optical night vision, SAR, SIGINT, EM spectrum monitoring, Hyperspectral. The project considers various technological and operational options in order to achieve the system objectives, such as: non-heliosynchronous orbits, inter-satellite links, advanced on-board processing, improved data downlink capabilities… Cost efficiency will be major driver during design trade-offs.\n2/ A User Service Centre, called Federation Layer, which provides end-users access to the satellites constellations from a single interface. It can also give access to other existing space systems that offer shared services. This centre supports various forms of transnational cooperation and automatically handles the sharing rules defined by each partner.\n\nActivities will be guided by inputs from the Member States Ministries of Defence. They will set the operational requirements and use-cases, which will drive the design and Concept of Operations. The project will include:\n- The preliminary design of the system, including preliminary performances analyses.\n- A study of how several new technologies can contribute to better or new capabilities in space and ground systems.

This concern is common to navigation applications, to Earth Observation applications and to Satellite Communication applications. RFI problems are also characterized, in the increasingly crowded space environment, by happening in any combination of location of the source of interference and the affected receiver, either in space or on Earth. Therefore, there is a growing demand to deal with RFI in a efficient and affordable way, both for civil and military use- and here is where RFSHIELD is positioned.\nThe main objective of RFSHIELD project is to increase the availability and performance of COMSATCOM/MILSATCOM services for military users by developing a European-made solution to protect the SatCom services from intentional and non-intentional interferences. It is the first European solution, that aims to do it in a waveform agnostic way while it is interoperable with the network equipment.\nWe are tackling two scenarios, CASE 1 and CASE 2, where the RFSHIELD solution is used either on-ground or space segments:\n-CASE 1: On the ground platform, RFSHIELD addresses wideband communication scenarios: the solution will detect and remove the interference on ground infrastructure (on-camp remote terminals and hub side) in military X, Ku, and Ka bands.

This concern is common to navigation applications, to Earth Observation applications and to Satellite Communication applications. RFI problems are also characterized, in the increasingly crowded space environment, by happening in any combination of location of the source of interference and the affected receiver, either in space or on Earth. Therefore, there is a growing demand to deal with RFI in a efficient and affordable way, both for civil and military use- and here is where RFSHIELD is positioned.\nThe main objective of RFSHIELD project is to increase the availability and performance of COMSATCOM/MILSATCOM services for military users by developing a European-made solution to protect the SatCom services from intentional and non-intentional interferences. It is the first European solution, that aims to do it in a waveform agnostic way while it is interoperable with the network equipment.\nWe are tackling two scenarios, CASE 1 and CASE 2, where the RFSHIELD solution is used either on-ground or space segments:\n-CASE 1: On the ground platform, RFSHIELD addresses wideband communication scenarios: the solution will detect and remove the interference on ground infrastructure (on-camp remote terminals and hub side) in military X, Ku, and Ka bands. The interferers are both external (jamming, radar or other terrestrial sources), or from the own defense unit (own ECM, ECCM systems)\n-CASE 2: On the space segment, RFSHIELD aims to protect a satellite payload working on UHF frequency with narrowband signals, mainly used for critical communications and positioning service. We address interference from other external devices. The objective is to filter/remove interference signals transmitting outside and within the working channels (by blanking a limited part of the spectrum to eliminate stronger

The project studies will address propulsion and energy systems technologies required for an highly efficient powerplant, able to deliver at the same time increased electrical power generation and increased thrust-to-weight ratio, that are not available today in Europe but will be necessary to cope with the mission requirements and operational needs of the next generation of fighter aircraft. The goal of the NEUMANN project is to develop technologies and perform collaborative system studies for novel energy aircraft domains, with focus on propulsion, and electrical and thermal systems and management, to achieve in 4-year period a proof of system integration functionalities and increased confidence in enabling technology readiness at both subsystems and system level up to TRL 4. Ground demonstrators will be used to assess technology integration and their validation. The project is organised in 9 work packages and coordinated by GE Avio. Besides the broad industry presence, it is of utmost importance that LEONARDO and SAAB as aircraft manufacturers are part of the NEUMANN project, which is fundamental for optimal power integration at platform level. The NEUMANN project will enable strategic autonomy in the defence sector for the power and propulsion systems, in particular for high temperature materials, thermal management enhanced by additive manufacturing technologies, energy generation and management and control systems.
