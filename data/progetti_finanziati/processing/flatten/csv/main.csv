• Research on innovative and low-cost CB monitoring technologies installed on UAV and UGV systems (building inter alia on the H2020 projects ROCSAFE and 5G!Drones, and focusing on miniaturization of previously deployed technological solutions);
• Research on innovative sampling technologies based primarily on the concept of “smart swabs”, enabling fast and non-destructive in situ analysis of a sample that can later be analyzed a second time in the lab by standard forensic;
• Nearly real-time 3D mapping and processing of areas affected by CBRN contamination (indoor and outdoor), with a high-degree of autonomy.
• Real-time visualization for Incident Commanders, including flowing of data from 3D mapping and CB monitoring sensors.
• Real-time communication between C2 systems and drones, robots and sensors for CB monitoring and sampling missions.

SCUALE consortium led by TDMS, consists of 14 partners representing 8 countries. The studies of the SCUALE project are articulated around three main themes: 
- Advanced lead-free materials and components research: carry out research for the development of advanced lead-free materials and components with physical and piezoelectric properties enabling the substitution of PZT in sonar applications. 
- Improving lead-free piezoelectric materials manufacturing processes: increase the manufacturing readiness level of the most mature lead-free piezoelectric materials and bring out one or more European industrial supplier of lead-free piezoelectric materials for sonar transducers. 
- PZT substitution in sonar transducers: increase the technology maturity of lead-free piezoelectric materials for PZT substitution in sonar applications and assess these new materials for sonar applications on representative test transducers under operational constraints. 

Also, SCUALE will undertake the development of disruptive lead-free ceramic processes such as textured ceramics and 3D printing as well as the development of disruptive fiber-optic sensing providing operational performance improvements in terms of bandwidth, system noise and weight.

Space-based Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems have become more and more performant and versatile. They are providing an ever-increasing number of services to support strategic, tactical and operational activities in security and defence. Technological developments have continuously improved performances but also lowered the costs of high-resolution systems. Over the past years, they have also made it possible to develop space solutions that answer military needs for shorter revisit periods (increased persistency), shorter end-to-end delays (system latency), new applications (e.g. night vision) or support to tactical operations.
Recent events have confirmed the important contribution of Space ISR to military operations as well as how critical reactivity and timely availability of data are. Keeping pace with the latest evolutions in Space ISR is essential for European security.
Today, several European countries operate Space ISR systems, either as national assets or under specific transnational cooperation agreements. These systems use a wide variety of traditional spaceborne sensors (optical, radar, SIGINT) and have provided European defence with an extensive experience on the use of Space ISR. Many European countries, which do not have direct access to a Space ISR system, receive space imagery through transnational cooperation.
Because the existing systems are operated independently, their revisit, persistency, reactivity and data diversity added value are limited to what each of them can offer on its own. Similarly, support at tactical level is only possible with nationally operated assets because current transnational data sharing time response is not compatible with tactical support.
The current organisation of multiple independent systems limits the capability to answer emerging needs on new applications, improved revisit, decreased latency or persistency at an affordable cost.
The Space Based Persistent ISR for Defence and Europe Reinforcement (SPIDER) project’s ambition is to provide European countries with Space ISR capabilities that are capable to answer to these new military needs in a cost-effective way.

This SPIDER proposal is a feasibility study about multi-mission affordable satellites constellations dedicated to space-based ISR for European defence. With the aim of providing:
- High reactivity, including autonomous re-tasking
- Short revisit periods
- Short end to end system latency
- Compatibility with existing national systems
- Compatibility with other European ISR initiative (e.g. CoHGI or AI for defence)

The main components of the system studied are:
1/ New self-standing small satellites constellations, able to cover a wide variety of mission: video, optical night vision, SAR, SIGINT, EM spectrum monitoring, Hyperspectral. The project considers various technological and operational options in order to achieve the system objectives, such as: non-heliosynchronous orbits, inter-satellite links, advanced on-board processing, improved data downlink capabilities… Cost efficiency will be major driver during design trade-offs.
2/ A User Service Centre, called Federation Layer, which provides end-users access to the satellites constellations from a single interface. It can also give access to other existing space systems that offer shared services. This centre supports various forms of transnational cooperation and automatically handles the sharing rules defined by each partner.

Activities will be guided by inputs from the Member States Ministries of Defence. They will set the operational requirements and use-cases, which will drive the design and Concept of Operations. The project will include:
- The preliminary design of the system, including preliminary performances analyses.
- A study of how several new technologies can contribute to better or new capabilities in space and ground systems. This will include risk reduction simulations or demonstrations.

To make sure that the designed Model is realistic, partial tests for risk reduction will be conducted at the end of the 2-year project and will allow to assess feasibility of the architectural interoperability model and its selected parameters.""",44175699,file.txt,"ATM,civil-military,information exchange,air defence,air C2,Single European Sky,interoperability",SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD,44181033101121440,101121440,EDF-2022-RA-C4ISR-AIRC2,20,0,19048832.29,"999809265,999904034,999991819,884772988,998325941,999939730,911149131,996375756,894728583,957954444,919527700,999959130,998627417,883848190,897926576,996531635,983564481,999961555,932760440,953620387",2023-12-01T00:00:00.000+0100,44181033,44173368,text/plain,2021 - 2027,SESIOP,European Defence Fund (EDF),2024-12-27T01:54:46.116+0100,"AIRBUS DEFENCE AND SPACE SAS,AALBORG UNIVERSITET,AIRBUS DEFENCE AND SPACE GMBH,ARBIT CYBER DEFENCE SYSTEMS APS,DEEP BLUE SRL,""THALES EDISOFT PORTUGAL, S.A."",UAB NOVIAN PRO,ECOLE NATIONALE DE L AVIATION CIVILE,ENERSEC TECHNOLOGY SRL,ERA AS,SXOLI IKARON,INDRA SISTEMAS SA,LEONARDO - SOCIETA PER  AZIONI,LUXTRUST SA,SPIKA TECH SL,TELEPLAN GLOBE AS,THALES HELLAS MONOPROSOPI ANONYMI ETAIREIA PARAGOGIS EMPORIAS KAI YPIRESION ILEKTRONIKOU EXOPLISMOU,THALES LAS FRANCE SAS,TEKNOLOGIAN TUTKIMUSKESKUS VTT OY,42 SOLUTIONS BV","20000890,20000875,20000873,20000875,20000922,20000990,20000944,20000890,20000994,20000872,20000902,20000883,20000922,20000945,20000883,20000974,20000902,20000890,20000885,20000973",98.81,https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/44181033/101121440/EDF,https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/44181033/101121440/EDF,18821665.29,2023-12-13T00:00:00.000+0100,2024-12-27T01:54:46.101+0100,European Defence Fund (EDF),45113611,"FRJ2,DK05,DE21,DK01,ITI4,PT17,LT01,FRJ2,RO32,CZ05,EL64,ES30,ITI4,LU00,ES30,NO08,EL64,FR10,FI1B,NL41",European Defence Fund (EDF),EDF,2024-11-25T15:23:35.884+0100

vehicles designed to operate in the sea/air interface, giving rise to a new type of unmanned craft, Unmanned WIG Vehicles. Such
vehicles could provide enormous advantages over any other locomotion means: they are extremely fast and energy efficient, capable
of very high payloads, inexpensive, long-range, do not require infrastructure or launch vehicle for departure and landing, and they
can be much more difficult to detect. Among others, the SEAWINGS solution can facilitate Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance
activities by EU Member States to increase strategic preparedness and to ensure the success of future defence-related operations and
missions.

SEAWINGS will conduct a series of complementary research, simulation and assessment activities to confirm and demonstrate the
potential capabilities of UWVs for a range of well-defined military and defence scenarios to support and enhance the EU maritime
capabilities. During the course of the project SEAWINGS will perform a combination of basic and applied research activities focused
on mechatronics, navigation, autonomy and control and sensor fusion experiments in order to establish specifications for WIG
vehicles to be successfully operated as drones. Efforts will lead to a large-scale SEAWINGS drone model and assessing it in a
representative environment. Specific objectives are: 1) Implement an architecture for the SEAWINGS platform to operate
autonomously, 2) Adapt and deliver the technological components for operational field circumstances, 3) Upgrade the operational
interface, supervision system, launch and recovery system for field trials and 4) Conduct and evaluate a series of partial field trials

vehicles could provide enormous advantages over any other locomotion means: they are extremely fast and energy efficient, capable
of very high payloads, inexpensive, long-range, do not require infrastructure or launch vehicle for departure and landing, and they
can be much more difficult to detect. Among others, the SEAWINGS solution can facilitate Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance
activities by EU Member States to increase strategic preparedness and to ensure the success of future defence-related operations and
missions.

SEAWINGS will conduct a series of complementary research, simulation and assessment activities to confirm and demonstrate the
potential capabilities of UWVs for a range of well-defined military and defence scenarios to support and enhance the EU maritime
capabilities. During the course of the project SEAWINGS will perform a combination of basic and applied research activities focused
on mechatronics, navigation, autonomy and control and sensor fusion experiments in order to establish specifications for WIG
vehicles to be successfully operated as drones. Efforts will lead to a large-scale SEAWINGS drone model and assessing it in a
representative environment. Specific objectives are: 1) Implement an architecture for the SEAWINGS platform to operate
autonomously, 2) Adapt and deliver the technological components for operational field circumstances, 3) Upgrade the operational
interface, supervision system, launch and recovery system for field trials and 4) Conduct and evaluate a series of partial field trials
according to increasing levels of difficulty. End-users will take active part in SEAWINGS implementation by providing their
requirements for the model.""",45095551,file.txt,"Drones,Sea,Air,Wing-in-Ground,Unmanned Wind-in-Ground Vehicles,Robotics,EU Defence",SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD,44181033101102763,101102763,EDF-2021-OPEN-R-SME-2,6,0,3927342.64,"954900496,999974844,999513706,890699882,988442029,888553854",2022-12-01T00:00:00.000+0100,44181033,45095543,text/plain,2021 - 2027,SEAWINGS,European Defence Fund (EDF),2024-12-26T18:00:13.605+0100,"LA PALMA RESEARCH CENTRE SL,UNIVERSIDAD POLITECNICA DE MADRID,""INESC TEC - INSTITUTO DE ENGENHARIADE SISTEMAS E COMPUTADORES, TECNOLOGIA E CIENCIA"",TRISOLARIS ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES LDA,ZANASI ALESSANDRO SRL,PORVALOR - ATIVOS DE ENGENHARIA LDA","20000883,20000883,20000990,20000990,20000922,20000990",,https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/44181033/101102763/EDF,https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/44181033/101102763/EDF,3927342.64,2022-12-07T00:00:00.000+0100,2024-12-26T18:00:13.589+0100,European Defence Fund (EDF),45297720,"ES70,ES30,PT11,PT20,ITH5,PT20",European Defence Fund (EDF),EDF,2024-10-24T13:28:54.813+0200

EDIDP-SME-2020-064-SRB, which ends after the initial prototype testing phase in Nov/2024, having so far successfully completed all milestones.
Rotary suspension technologies fit particularly well on tracked vehicles due to their compactness, robustness, and incomparable energy dissipated/space claim ratio. In the past, the constant increase in weight and high–mobility requirements have challenged the different suspension technologies.
Rotary dampers have notably increased their energy dissipation capabilities by moving from friction-based technologies to Full Hydraulic high efficiency/low maintenance rotary dampers.
As opposed to current solutions (hydropneumatics cylinders, torsion bar with mechanic or hydraulic damper, rocker actuated rotary suspension systems based on hydropneumatics cylinders) this system would be able to offer a much better performance as well as a much easier integrability. Its suspension travel to space claim required ratio will, whilst maintaining high force damping, ensure a much better vehicle mobility, performance, and product integrability. Another added advantage of the system, will be the possibility to regulate the vehicle ride height, ensuring it is always tailored to the vehicle’s specific need. The final system will also be able to operate under aggressive environments and extremely harsh temperature conditions without detriment to the system’s performance.

REACT II will bring all the progress made and the lessons learned from REACT I (awarded proposal for EDIDP-ACC-AEAC-2019). All this experience gathered is an invaluable asset to build on for the new project to be undertaken.
The REACT II solution to cover the future challenges for AEA capability will be comprised by a modular architecture-based system whose core building blocks will allow to reconfigure the system to better adapt to the needs of the mission to be performed. Some of the most important building blocks are those dedicated to AESA, DRFM, Digital Beam Forming, RAT-ECS, amongst others which will be detailed in section 8.2 (WP4).
The REACT II system solution will be capable of performing Escort jamming / Modified, Stand-Off Jamming, Stand-In Jamming, Electronic Warfare Command and Control and Cyber and Electromagnetic Activities.
Regarding the impact of REACT II on the EU MS is not only limited to their Air Forces capabilities, but also to their defence industry sector.

This concern is common to navigation applications, to Earth Observation applications and to Satellite Communication applications. RFI problems are also characterized, in the increasingly crowded space environment, by happening in any combination of location of the source of interference and the affected receiver, either in space or on Earth. Therefore, there is a growing demand to deal with RFI in a efficient and affordable way, both for civil and military use- and here is where RFSHIELD is positioned.
The main objective of RFSHIELD project is to increase the availability and performance of COMSATCOM/MILSATCOM services for military users by developing a European-made solution to protect the SatCom services from intentional and non-intentional interferences. It is the first European solution, that aims to do it in a waveform agnostic way while it is interoperable with the network equipment.
We are tackling two scenarios, CASE 1 and CASE 2, where the RFSHIELD solution is used either on-ground or space segments:
-CASE 1: On the ground platform, RFSHIELD addresses wideband communication scenarios: the solution will detect and remove the interference on ground infrastructure (on-camp remote terminals and hub side) in military X, Ku, and Ka bands. The interferers are both external (jamming, radar or other terrestrial sources), or from the own defense unit (own ECM, ECCM systems)
-CASE 2: On the space segment, RFSHIELD aims to protect a satellite payload working on UHF frequency with narrowband signals, mainly used for critical communications and positioning service. We address interference from other external devices. The objective is to filter/remove interference signals transmitting outside and within the working channels (by blanking a limited part of the spectrum to eliminate stronger interferers).""",en,RF INTERFERENCE REMOVAL FOR MILITARY SERVICES BASED ON SPACES LINK,16458C4591BBEDA79FC7A1EC808CD1AE61D81959F1BFE54FA456780C85732B2D,"""The problems derived from manmade RF interference (RFI), whether generated intentionally or not, remain one of the main concerns of the space industry.

process capacity and IMINT analysts.
IntSen2 aims at researching a disruptive change, using Artificial Intelligence to develop a concept of application for an IMINT service,
from a reactive service design to a proactive service design. And it does so by basing the research and proposed solutions exclusively
on European assets in order to support EU operational autonomy. This proposal, therefore, will design a system to fully automatize
the IMINT workflow, consisting of: i) Automatic Acquisition, ii) Automatic Pre-processing; iii) (Key Challenge) Automatic Extraction, iv)
Automatic report generation; v) Automatic Dashboard management.
Two technologies using Artificial Intelligence lie at the core of the solution that IntSen2 proposes:
- Super-resolution: Improving the resolution of imagery by a factor of 4 allows imagery from Sentinel satellites to provide
value in security scenarios.
- Automatic Extraction: Applying AI based extraction techniques to super-resolved Sentinel imagery can unlock the use of all
operational potential of Sentinel for security scenarios.
Under this context, IntSen2 appears as the first urgent step for creating the infrastructures that the EC needs for obtaining an
autonomous and independent intelligence that can face the rise of capabilities of major third countries and contribute to a Common

At the ground combat level, major threats are modern main battle tanks that apply active protection systems and improved explosive reactive armour, as well as infrastructures that integrate high-performance concrete. 

These threats will become even more challenging: besides Russia, China will soon possess similar systems, which will also become more present in North Africa and the Middle East in the coming years. 

New warhead technologies are a must-have for the armed forces of EU Member States to keep their lead and defeat these threats. NEWHEAT aims to improve the performance of conventional shaped charge by integrating new high explosive, new liner materials and new geometries. To go beyond the State-of-the-Art and address future challenges, NEWHEAT will also focus on the development of new concepts and demonstrators for warheads: 
- Explosively Formed Projectiles 
- Multi-Liner Explosively Formed Projectiles 
- Slow Stretching Jet Shaped Charges

NEWHEAT will gather the background and know-how of 8 partners and 5 subcontractors (including one SME, one mid-cap, 5 large companies and 6 RTO) from 7 countries to develop, design and test these new concepts. This ambitious research project, implemented over 36 months, represents an unprecedented opportunity for the partners to enforce cross-border cooperation and pave the way for new cooperation, development actions, and industrialization after the end of the project.
